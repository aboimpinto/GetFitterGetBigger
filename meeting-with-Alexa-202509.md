# Revolutionizing Athlete & Coach Performance
Meeting with Alexa 11-09-2925


## **The Universal Problem in Coaching**
The world of elite coaching still heavily relies on outdated tools. The number one tool is the spreadsheet.

Spreadsheets are inefficient, prone to errors, create version control issues, and fail to provide dynamic feedback or engagement for the athlete. There's a major disconnect between the plan and the execution.


## **The Fitness App**
**GetFitterGetBigger** is a dynamic training ecosystem designed to eliminate spreadsheets and generic fitness plans. It's a centralized platform where science-backed, sport-specific training becomes accessible to everyone.

**For Coaches:** It's a command center. They can build, assign, monitor, and adapt training programs for their entire roster of athletes in one place, saving hours of administrative work.

**For Athletes:** It's a clear path to improvement. It provides focused training programs tailored to the unique physical demands of their sport, helping them break through plateaus and prevent injuries.


## **Who We Serve: A Two-Sided Ecosystem**
Our target audience is a symbiotic relationship between two key groups:

1. **The Athletes:** We cater to the full spectrum of athletic life:
    * **The Developing Athlete:** Young competitors in any sport (swimming, tennis, football, etc.) who need foundational strength to advance.
    * **The Performance Athlete:** High-level amateurs and professionals seeking that extra 1-5% edge.
    * **The Everyday Performer:** The dedicated gym-goer who wants structured, goal-oriented training instead of just "winging it."
    * **The Longevity Seeker:** Older individuals who need targeted mobility and strength work to maintain a high quality of life.

2. **The Coaches & Personal Trainers (PTs):**
They are the lifeblood of our platform. We empower them with tools to scale their business, manage clients more effectively, and deliver superior results. They will populate the app with expert, specialized workout programs.


## **The Differentiator: Why We Win**
* **Beyond Cardio Metrics:**
You asked about statistics and reports. Yes, apps like Garmin, Whoop, and Strava are great, but they are fundamentally masters of endurance metricsâ€”pace, distance, heart rate. They can tell a runner how fast they ran, but they can't track the strength, power, and stability improvements in the gym that made them faster.

* **Sport-Specific Performance Data**
We are different because we track the foundational metrics that lead to athletic improvement. Our platform is designed to capture and analyze data like:
    * **Workload on specific muscle groups** for a pitcher's shoulder or a footballer's legs.
    * **Improvements in explosive power** measured through jump height or bar speed during a lift.
    * **Progress in mobility and stability** exercises, crucial for injury prevention in sports like gymnastics or martial arts.
    * We can quantify if a swimmer's dry-land training is actually translating to more powerful starts and turns.

* **A Content Marketplace:** Coaches don't just use our app; they build their business on it. They can publish their unique training philosophies and programs, creating a rich marketplace of expertise that athletes can tap into.


## The Strategic Synergy: Value Proposition for a Partner
* **A Powerful Value-Add:** The app can be integrated into a service package for clubs and athletes, offering an immediate, tangible technology and data solution.

* **Data for Business Development:** The platform generates objective performance data. This data is invaluable for justifying an athlete's value to potential sponsors.

* **Operational Efficiency:** For any organization managing multiple athletes or teams, the platform allows for streamlined monitoring and support, enabling them to scale their operations.


## The Business Model: How It Thrives
* **Athlete Tier:** A freemium model. Core features are free, with a premium subscription unlocking advanced analytics and content.
* **Coach/Professional Tier:** A recurring SaaS (Software as a Service) subscription that provides the tools to manage clients and monetize their expertise on the platform.


## Next steps:
* **Phase 1:** Building the Coach Command Center.
* **Phase 2:** Launching the Athlete Mobile Experience.
* **Phase 3:** Provide the app to a close group of athletes to tests it (last quarter 2025)
* **Phase 4:** Publish it to Apple Store and Google Play (second quarter 2026)
