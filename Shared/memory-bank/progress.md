# Project Progress

## Current Status

The GetFitterGetBigger ecosystem is in various stages of development across its components. The Shared Models project serves as the foundation for data consistency across all components.

### Project Timeline

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Shared Models | âœ… Basic Models Implemented | Core models (Exercise, Workout) defined |
| API Application | ðŸ”„ Initial Setup | Project structure and basic endpoints created |
| Admin Application | ðŸ”„ Authentication Implemented | Google and Facebook authentication with user profile |
| Client Applications | ðŸ”„ UI Framework Setup | Avalonia UI setup with basic navigation |

## What Works

### Shared Models
- Basic Exercise and Workout models defined
- XML documentation for model properties
- Project references set up for all components

### API Documentation
- Documentation structure established
- Authentication endpoints documented
- Workout retrieval endpoints documented
- Metadata for identifying which projects use each endpoint

### Memory Bank
- Comprehensive documentation for all components
- Consistent structure across all memory bank files
- System architecture diagrams for visualizing component interactions

### Cross-Component Integration
- API-first architecture established
- Shared models referenced by all components
- Authentication mechanism defined

## What's Left to Build

### Shared Models Enhancements
- **Exercise Model and DTOs:** Define the `Exercise` model and the DTOs required for API communication, as specified in the `api-docs/exercises.md` documentation.
- User profile and authentication models
- Training plan models
- Progress tracking models
- Additional workout properties
- Comprehensive validation attributes

### API Documentation Completion
- Document remaining API endpoints
- Validate documentation against implementation
- Ensure all endpoints have appropriate metadata

### Cross-Component Testing
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Data consistency validation
- Authentication and authorization testing

## Known Issues

- No comprehensive test suite for shared models
- Limited validation attributes on model properties
- Documentation for some API endpoints is incomplete
- Memory bank update script needs refinement

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions

1. **API-First Architecture**
   - Decision to use a central API for all data operations
   - Separation of concerns between components
   - Business logic primarily in the API layer

2. **Shared Models Approach**
   - Decision to define models once in a shared project
   - All components reference the same models
   - Changes to models propagate to all components

3. **Cross-Platform Client Applications**
   - Decision to use Avalonia UI for client applications
   - Support for Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop
   - Consistent user experience across platforms

### Refined Decisions

1. **Authentication Mechanism**
   - JWT-based authentication for all components
   - Role-based authorization for access control
   - External providers (Google, Facebook) for Admin application

2. **API Documentation Strategy**
   - Each endpoint documented in its own file
   - Metadata to identify which projects use each endpoint
   - Memory bank update script to propagate changes

3. **Memory Bank Structure**
   - Consistent structure across all components
   - Regular updates to reflect current state
   - System architecture diagrams for visualization

### Future Decision Points

1. **Database Technology**
   - Evaluate options for database technology
   - Consider performance, scalability, and ease of use
   - Ensure compatibility with Entity Framework Core

2. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Determine hosting options for each component
   - Consider containerization for easier deployment
   - Establish CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Decide on monitoring and analytics tools
   - Implement logging and error tracking
   - Gather usage statistics for feature prioritization
