# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The GetFitterGetBigger ecosystem is currently in various stages of development across its components. The Shared Models project serves as the foundation for data consistency across all components.

### Current Priorities

1. **API Documentation**
   - Documenting all API endpoints in the api-docs folder
   - Ensuring metadata correctly identifies which projects use each endpoint
   - Validating that the memory bank update script correctly propagates changes

2. **Shared Models Enhancement**
   - **Define Exercise Model:** Create the `Exercise.cs` model and related DTOs to support the new Exercise Management feature. This includes properties for `name`, `description`, `instructions`, `difficulty`, `video_url`, `image_url`, and `is_unilateral`.
   - Refining the Workout model to support all required features
   - Adding XML documentation to all model properties
   - Ensuring models meet the needs of all components

3. **Cross-Component Consistency**
   - Aligning technology versions across all components
   - Ensuring consistent authentication mechanisms
   - Standardizing error handling and response formats

## Recent Changes

1. **Memory Bank Updates**
   - Created comprehensive memory bank documentation for all components
   - Ensured consistency across all memory bank files
   - Added system architecture diagrams to visualize component interactions

2. **API Documentation**
   - Added documentation for authentication endpoints
   - Added documentation for workout retrieval endpoints
   - Included metadata to identify which projects use each endpoint

3. **Shared Models**
   - Defined the Exercise model with properties for all required features
   - Defined the Workout model with properties for all required features
   - Added XML documentation to all model properties

## Next Steps

1. **Complete API Documentation**
   - Document remaining API endpoints
   - Validate endpoint documentation against actual implementation
   - Ensure all endpoints have appropriate metadata

2. **Enhance Shared Models**
   - Add models for user profiles and authentication
   - Add models for training plans and progress tracking
   - Ensure all models have comprehensive XML documentation

3. **Implement Cross-Component Testing**
   - Develop integration tests to validate component interactions
   - Ensure data consistency across all components
   - Validate authentication and authorization mechanisms

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **API-First Approach**
   - All data operations go through the API
   - Business logic primarily resides in the API layer
   - Client applications focus on presentation and user interaction

2. **Shared Models Strategy**
   - Models defined once in the Shared project
   - All components reference the same models
   - Changes to models propagate to all components

3. **Authentication Mechanism**
   - JWT-based authentication for all components
   - Role-based authorization for access control
   - Secure token storage and transmission

### Design Considerations

1. **Model Granularity**
   - Models should be granular enough to support all required features
   - But not so granular that they become difficult to manage
   - Balance between flexibility and simplicity

2. **Versioning Strategy**
   - Semantic versioning for all components
   - API versioning to support backward compatibility
   - Model versioning to handle schema changes

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Consistent documentation format across all components
   - XML documentation for all public APIs
   - Memory bank updates for all significant changes

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **API Documentation Pattern**
   - Each endpoint documented in its own file
   - Consistent structure for all documentation
   - Metadata to identify which projects use each endpoint

2. **Model Definition Pattern**
   - Properties with XML documentation
   - Appropriate data types and validation attributes
   - Consistent naming conventions

3. **Memory Bank Update Pattern**
   - Script to propagate changes to relevant projects
   - Consistent structure across all memory bank files
   - Regular updates to reflect current state

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **Cross-Component Coordination**
   - Changes to shared models impact all components
   - Coordination required to ensure smooth transitions
   - Documentation critical for maintaining consistency

2. **API-First Benefits**
   - Clearer separation of concerns
   - More flexible technology choices
   - Easier testing and validation

3. **Documentation Value**
   - Memory bank documentation provides clear context
   - API documentation ensures consistent implementation
   - Model documentation guides proper usage
