# Product Context

## Problem Statement

In the fitness industry, there are several challenges that affect both Personal Trainers (PTs) and their clients:

1. **Communication Gap**: Traditional methods of sharing workout plans (paper, generic apps, spreadsheets) create distance between PTs and clients
2. **Data Consistency**: Using different systems for creating and consuming workout content leads to inconsistencies
3. **Cross-Platform Needs**: Clients need access to their workout plans across various devices and platforms
4. **Content Management**: PTs need efficient tools to create, organize, and distribute workout content
5. **Progress Tracking**: Both PTs and clients need ways to track and visualize fitness progress

## Solution Overview

The GetFitterGetBigger ecosystem addresses these challenges through a connected platform with shared data models:

1. **Shared Models (Current Project)**
   - Provides consistent data structures across all components
   - Ensures that all parts of the ecosystem speak the same language
   - Simplifies development and maintenance of the entire system

2. **API Application**
   - Serves as the central data processing hub
   - Handles all database operations
   - Provides standardized endpoints for both Admin and Client applications

3. **Admin Application**
   - Gives PTs tools to create and manage fitness content
   - Allows assignment of content to specific clients
   - Provides insights into client progress
