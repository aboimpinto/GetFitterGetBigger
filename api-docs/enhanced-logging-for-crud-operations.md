# Enhanced Logging for CRUD Operations

This document provides guidelines for implementing comprehensive logging in CRUD operations, with a specific focus on update scenarios such as equipment updates.

## Overview

Effective logging in CRUD operations is essential for debugging, auditing, and maintaining data integrity. This guide outlines what information should be captured at each stage of the operation lifecycle.

## What to Log at Each Stage

### 1. Request Reception Stage

When a request is received by the API endpoint:
- HTTP method and full request path
- Request timestamp with precise timing
- Request correlation ID for tracing
- Authentication context (user ID, roles, claims)
- Client information (IP address, user agent)
- Request headers relevant to the operation

### 2. Request Payload Logging

The incoming request payload should be logged with:
- Complete request body in its original format
- Content-Type header value
- Request size in bytes
- Any validation errors encountered during deserialization
- Sanitized version if sensitive data is present (mask passwords, tokens, etc.)

### 3. Pre-Update Entity State

Before performing any updates:
- Current entity values from the database
- Entity ID and any composite key information
- Entity version/timestamp for optimistic concurrency
- Related entities that might be affected
- Any calculated or derived values
- Database transaction ID if available

### 4. Update Process Logging

During the update operation:
- Mapping between request fields and entity properties
- Fields that are being modified vs. unchanged
- Any business rules or validations being applied
- Computed values or transformations
- Authorization checks performed
- Database connection information (without credentials)

### 5. SQL Parameter Logging

When executing database commands:
- Parameterized SQL command text
- Parameter names and their corresponding values
- Parameter data types and sizes
- Database provider-specific parameter formatting
- Execution plan information if available
- Query execution time

### 6. Post-Update Entity State

After the update completes:
- New entity values after the update
- Changed fields with before/after comparison
- Updated version/timestamp information
- Any cascading changes to related entities
- Audit trail entries created
- Database-generated values (timestamps, sequences)

### 7. Response Preparation

When preparing the response:
- Response status code
- Response body structure
- Any transformations applied for the response
- Response headers added
- Total operation duration

## Structured Logging Best Practices

### Use Consistent Log Levels

- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for development (entity states, SQL parameters)
- **INFO**: High-level operation flow (request received, update completed)
- **WARNING**: Non-critical issues (deprecated fields used, performance concerns)
- **ERROR**: Operation failures requiring attention
- **CRITICAL**: System-level failures affecting multiple operations

### Implement Correlation IDs

- Generate unique correlation IDs for each request
- Pass correlation IDs through all layers of the application
- Include correlation IDs in all related log entries
- Enable tracing across distributed systems

### Structure Log Entries

- Use consistent field names across all log entries
- Include contextual information in every log entry
- Separate technical details from business information
- Use nested structures for complex data
- Maintain consistent timestamp formats

### Performance Considerations

- Log asynchronously to avoid blocking operations
- Implement log sampling for high-volume endpoints
- Use appropriate log retention policies
- Consider log aggregation and indexing strategies
- Monitor logging overhead and adjust verbosity

### Security and Compliance

- Never log sensitive information in plain text
- Implement data masking for PII and credentials
- Follow regulatory requirements for audit trails
- Separate security logs from operational logs
- Implement log access controls

### Error Handling in Logging

- Ensure logging failures don't crash the application
- Implement fallback logging mechanisms
- Monitor the health of logging infrastructure
- Alert on logging system failures
- Maintain operation continuity even if logging fails

## Equipment Update Specific Considerations

For equipment update scenarios specifically:
- Log equipment identification details (ID, name, category)
- Track changes to technical specifications
- Record modifications to availability status
- Document location or assignment changes
- Capture maintenance schedule updates
- Log any related calibration or certification changes

## Log Retention and Analysis

- Define retention periods based on operational needs
- Implement log rotation strategies
- Set up automated log analysis for patterns
- Create dashboards for common issues
- Enable quick searching and filtering capabilities

## Integration with Monitoring Systems

- Forward logs to centralized logging systems
- Set up alerts for specific patterns or errors
- Integrate with APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools
- Enable distributed tracing capabilities
- Implement real-time log streaming for critical operations
