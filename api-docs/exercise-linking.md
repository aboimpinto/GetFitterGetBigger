## Overview

The Exercise Linking feature allows Personal Trainers to create relationships between exercises based on their type (Warmup, Workout, Cooldown). This feature streamlines workout creation by automatically suggesting or including appropriate warmup and cooldown exercises when a main workout exercise is selected.

## Business Purpose

Personal Trainers often follow patterns when designing workouts:
- Specific warmup exercises prepare the body for certain workout movements
- Appropriate cooldown exercises help with recovery after intense exercises

By capturing these relationships, the system can:
- Speed up workout creation
- Ensure consistency in workout design
- Share expertise across the PT team
- Reduce injury risk through proper exercise sequencing

## Feature Components

### API (FEAT-022)
- New entity: ExerciseLink
- CRUD endpoints for managing exercise links
- Validation to ensure proper exercise type relationships
- Prevention of circular references
- Suggested links based on usage patterns

### Admin UI (FEAT-018)
- Visual interface for creating and managing exercise links
- Drag-and-drop ordering of linked exercises
- Search and filter capabilities
- Link indicators in exercise lists
- Responsive design for mobile use

### Clients (Future)
- Display linked exercises during workout execution
- Auto-include warmups and cooldowns in workout flow
- Visual indicators for exercise relationships

## How It Works

### For Personal Trainers

1. **Creating Links**
   - Select a workout exercise (e.g., "Barbell Squat")
   - Add warmup exercises (e.g., "Bodyweight Squat", "Leg Swings")
   - Add cooldown exercises (e.g., "Quad Stretch", "Hamstring Stretch")
   - Set the order for multiple linked exercises

2. **Using Links**
   - When building a workout, select "Barbell Squat"
   - System suggests including the linked warmups and cooldowns
   - PT can accept, modify, or skip the suggestions
   - Workout is created with proper exercise sequence

### For End Users

1. **Workout Experience**
   - See complete workout with warmups and cooldowns
   - Understand exercise relationships
   - Follow proper exercise progression
   - Reduce injury risk

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model
```
Exercise (existing)
    ↓
ExerciseLink (new)
    - SourceExerciseId (Workout type)
    - TargetExerciseId (Warmup/Cooldown type)
    - LinkType (Warmup|Cooldown)
    - DisplayOrder
```

### Business Rules
- Only Workout exercises can be source exercises
- Warmup exercises can only be linked as warmups
- Cooldown exercises can only be linked as cooldowns
- Rest exercises cannot participate in linking
- No circular references allowed

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/exercises/{id}/links` - Create link
- `GET /api/exercises/{id}/links` - Get all links
- `PUT /api/exercises/{id}/links/{linkId}` - Update link
- `DELETE /api/exercises/{id}/links/{linkId}` - Delete link
- `GET /api/exercises/{id}/suggested-links` - Get suggestions

## Benefits

### For Personal Trainers
- **Efficiency**: Build workouts faster
- **Consistency**: Maintain workout quality
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Capture and share expertise
- **Flexibility**: Override suggestions when needed

### For Gym Members
- **Safety**: Proper warmup and cooldown
- **Education**: Learn exercise relationships
- **Results**: Better workout effectiveness
- **Experience**: Smoother workout flow

### For Gym Owners
- **Quality**: Consistent service delivery
- **Safety**: Reduced injury liability
- **Differentiation**: Advanced workout planning
- **Scalability**: New PTs learn faster

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)
- Basic link creation and management
- Simple UI for PTs
- Manual link creation

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Future)
- Usage-based suggestions
- Pattern recognition
- Bulk operations
- Templates

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- AI-powered recommendations
- Client personalization
- Analytics and insights
- Cross-gym sharing

## Success Metrics

- Number of exercise links created
- Usage of linked exercises in workouts
- Time saved in workout creation
- Reduction in workout-related injuries
- PT satisfaction scores
- Client workout completion rates

## Security and Permissions

- **Create/Edit/Delete Links**: PT-Tier, Admin-Tier only
- **View Links**: All authenticated users
- **Audit Trail**: Track who creates/modifies links
- **Data Validation**: Prevent invalid relationships

## Migration and Adoption

1. **Training**: PT workshop on using exercise links
2. **Seed Data**: Pre-populate common exercise links
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with power users
4. **Feedback Loop**: Iterate based on PT input
5. **Full Launch**: Enable for all PTs
