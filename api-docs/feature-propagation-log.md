This document tracks features that have been propagated from the API to Admin and Clients projects.

## Propagation Date: 2025-06-29

### Features Propagated

#### 1. MuscleGroup CRUD Operations
- **API Completion Date**: 2025-01-29
- **Feature IDs**: 
  - API: Original implementation
  - Admin: FEAT-ADMIN-001
  - Clients: FEAT-CLIENTS-001
- **Status**: Propagated to 0-SUBMITTED in both Admin and Clients
- **Summary**: MuscleGroups converted from read-only to full CRUD, enabling dynamic management

#### 2. REST Exercise Optional Muscle Groups  
- **API Completion Date**: 2025-06-29
- **Feature IDs**:
  - API: Original implementation
  - Admin: FEAT-ADMIN-002
  - Clients: FEAT-CLIENTS-002
- **Status**: Propagated to 0-SUBMITTED in both Admin and Clients
- **Summary**: REST exercises no longer require muscle groups or other reference data

### Documentation Updates

#### Created Documents
1. `/api-docs/feature-bug-workflow-changes.md` - Comprehensive summary of all workflow changes
2. `/api-docs/testing-guidelines.md` - Unified testing guidelines for all projects
3. `/api-docs/feature-propagation-log.md` - This tracking document

#### Updated Documents
1. `/api-docs/development-workflow-process.md` - Added time tracking, enhanced quality gates, and key process rules

### Process Improvements Documented

1. **Mandatory 0-SUBMITTED State**: All features must start here, no exceptions
2. **Enhanced Time Tracking**: New format with AI assistance impact
3. **Boy Scout Rule**: Now mandatory for all work
4. **Feature ID Usage**: Required in all references
5. **User Approval**: Explicit approval needed for COMPLETED state
6. **Testing Standards**: >80% branch coverage target

## Next Steps

### For Admin Team
1. Review features in 0-SUBMITTED folder
2. Analyze impact on Admin application
3. Create implementation tasks
4. Move to 1-READY_TO_DEVELOP when ready

### For Clients Team  
1. Review features in 0-SUBMITTED folder
2. Analyze impact on each platform (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
3. Create platform-specific tasks
4. Move to 1-READY_TO_DEVELOP when ready

### For API Team
1. Continue following the established workflow
2. Propagate future features promptly
3. Maintain clear API documentation

## Notes
- Both Admin and Clients projects already had the workflow structure in place
- Focus was on propagating specific completed features
- All workflow documentation was already synchronized
- Testing guidelines enhanced for consistency
