  - Admin: FEAT-ADMIN-002
  - Clients: FEAT-CLIENTS-002
- **Status**: Propagated to 0-SUBMITTED in both Admin and Clients
- **Summary**: REST exercises no longer require muscle groups or other reference data

### Documentation Updates

#### Created Documents
1. `/api-docs/feature-bug-workflow-changes.md` - Comprehensive summary of all workflow changes
2. `/api-docs/testing-guidelines.md` - Unified testing guidelines for all projects
3. `/api-docs/feature-propagation-log.md` - This tracking document

#### Updated Documents
1. `/api-docs/development-workflow-process.md` - Added time tracking, enhanced quality gates, and key process rules

### Process Improvements Documented

1. **Mandatory 0-SUBMITTED State**: All features must start here, no exceptions
2. **Enhanced Time Tracking**: New format with AI assistance impact
3. **Boy Scout Rule**: Now mandatory for all work
4. **Feature ID Usage**: Required in all references
5. **User Approval**: Explicit approval needed for COMPLETED state
6. **Testing Standards**: >80% branch coverage target

## Next Steps

### For Admin Team
1. Review features in 0-SUBMITTED folder
2. Analyze impact on Admin application
3. Create implementation tasks
4. Move to 1-READY_TO_DEVELOP when ready

### For Clients Team  
1. Review features in 0-SUBMITTED folder
2. Analyze impact on each platform (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
3. Create platform-specific tasks
4. Move to 1-READY_TO_DEVELOP when ready

### For API Team
1. Continue following the established workflow
2. Propagate future features promptly
3. Maintain clear API documentation

### Features Propagated

#### 3. Equipment CRUD Operations
- **API Completion Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Feature IDs**: 
  - API: FEAT-013 (marked as IN_PROGRESS but implementation is complete)
  - Admin: FEAT-equipment-management
  - Clients: FEAT-equipment-reference-data
- **Status**: Propagated to 0-SUBMITTED in both Admin and Clients
- **Summary**: Equipment converted from read-only to full CRUD with soft delete support
- **Key Changes**:
  - Admin: Full CRUD interface for equipment management
  - Clients: Read-only access for equipment reference data
  - Soft delete implementation maintains referential integrity
  - Case-insensitive unique name validation

## Notes
- Both Admin and Clients projects already had the workflow structure in place
- Focus was on propagating specific completed features
- All workflow documentation was already synchronized
- Testing guidelines enhanced for consistency

### Features Propagated

#### 5. Exercise Weight Type Classification
- **API Completion Date**: 2025-07-10 (IN_PROGRESS - implementation complete, pending final testing)
- **Feature IDs**: 
  - API: FEAT-023
  - Admin: FEAT-019
  - Clients: Not applicable (Admin-only feature for exercise management)
- **Status**: Propagated to 0-SUBMITTED in Admin
- **Summary**: Exercise weight type classification system with 5 predefined categories for standardized weight handling
- **Key Changes**:
  - Admin: Complete UI component system for weight type management
  - Weight types: BODYWEIGHT_ONLY, BODYWEIGHT_OPTIONAL, WEIGHT_REQUIRED, MACHINE_WEIGHT, NO_WEIGHT
  - Dynamic weight input validation based on exercise type
  - Enhanced exercise management with weight type selection and badges
  - Bulk update capabilities for existing exercise migration

### Features Propagated

#### 4. Exercise Kinetic Chain Field
- **API Completion Date**: 2025-07-07 (IN_PROGRESS - implementation complete, pending testing)
- **Feature IDs**: 
  - API: FEAT-019
  - Admin: FEAT-017
  - Clients: Not yet propagated
- **Status**: Propagated to 0-SUBMITTED in Admin
- **Summary**: Added Kinetic Chain field to categorize exercises as Compound or Isolation movements
- **Key Changes**:
  - New required field for non-REST exercises
  - Two kinetic chain types: Compound (multi-muscle) and Isolation (single-muscle)
  - Validation rules based on exercise type
  - Reference table endpoint: `/api/referenceTables/kineticChainTypes`
- **Documentation**: Created `/api-docs/exercise-kinetic-chain.md` with full specification

### Process Documentation

#### Created Documents
1. `/GetFitterGetBigger.Admin/memory-bank/API-FEATURE-PROPAGATION-PROCESS.md` - Comprehensive guide for propagating API features to frontend projects
   - Emphasizes independent feature numbering per project
   - Details the 0-SUBMITTED workflow
   - Includes best practices and common pitfalls

## Notes
- FEAT-019 demonstrates the proper propagation process with independent numbering
- Admin project maintains its own feature sequence (FEAT-017)
- Process documentation created to standardize future propagations
