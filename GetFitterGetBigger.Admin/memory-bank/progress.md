## Reference Data API Integration Guide

This section outlines how the Admin application should connect to and consume the Reference Tables API.

### API Connection Details

*   **Development Base URL:** `http://localhost:5214`

This URL should be configured in `appsettings.Development.json` to be used by the `HttpClient` service.

### Endpoint Mapping

The following table maps each reference data type to its specific API endpoint path.

| Reference Table     | API Endpoint Path                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| BodyParts           | `/api/ReferenceTables/BodyParts`           |
| DifficultyLevels    | `/api/ReferenceTables/DifficultyLevels`    |
| Equipment           | `/api/ReferenceTables/Equipment`           |
| KineticChainTypes   | `/api/ReferenceTables/KineticChainTypes`   |
| MetricTypes         | `/api/ReferenceTables/MetricTypes`         |
| MovementPatterns    | `/api/ReferenceTables/MovementPatterns`    |
| MuscleGroups        | `/api/ReferenceTables/MuscleGroups`        |
| MuscleRoles         | `/api/ReferenceTables/MuscleRoles`         |

### Implementation Proposal: `ReferenceDataService`

To centralize data fetching and caching, a `ReferenceDataService` should be implemented.

*   **Architecture:**
    *   Create an `IReferenceDataService` interface.
    *   Create a `ReferenceDataService` class that implements the interface.
    *   Register the service as a singleton in `Program.cs` to manage a shared cache.

*   **Example Usage:**
    ```csharp
    public class ReferenceDataService : IReferenceDataService
    {
        private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
        private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;
        private const string ApiBaseUrl = "http://localhost:5214"; // Should be injected from IConfiguration

        public ReferenceDataService(HttpClient httpClient, IMemoryCache cache)
        {
            _httpClient = httpClient;
            _cache = cache;
        }

        public async Task<IEnumerable<ReferenceDataDto>> GetDifficultyLevelsAsync()
        {
            const string cacheKey = "DifficultyLevels";
            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out IEnumerable<ReferenceDataDto> cachedData))
            {
                var requestUrl = $"{ApiBaseUrl}/api/ReferenceTables/DifficultyLevels";
                cachedData = await _httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<IEnumerable<ReferenceDataDto>>(requestUrl);
                
                // Cache with a long expiration for static data
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, cachedData, TimeSpan.FromHours(24));
            }
            return cachedData;
        }

        // ... methods for other reference tables
    }
    ```

*   **Caching Strategy:**
    *   **Time-Based:** Use long expiration for static data (e.g., `BodyParts`) and shorter expiration for dynamic data (e.g., `Equipment`).
    *   **Explicit:** The service should include a method to manually invalidate cache keys, which can be triggered by UI actions.

## New Tasks

*   **Task:** Implement ReferenceDataService for API Communication
    *   **Description:** Implement the `IReferenceDataService` and `ReferenceDataService` as detailed in the "Reference Data API Integration Guide". This includes configuring the `HttpClient`, implementing methods for all reference table endpoints, and setting up the specified caching strategy.
    *   **Status:** `[SUBMITTED]`

## What's Left to Build

## Known Issues

- ~~Tailwind CSS build process issue~~ (RESOLVED): Fixed issue with PostCSS plugin by updating to use Tailwind CLI directly
- Project is following standard Blazor patterns and practices
- Browser testing limitations: The embedded browser in the development environment may not fully render all UI elements. For comprehensive testing, use a standard browser and provide feedback on any issues.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Blazor selected for its C# integration and component model
   - .NET 9.0 chosen as the latest stable platform
   - Tailwind CSS identified as the styling framework
   - Tailwind CSS build process updated to use CLI directly instead of PostCSS plugin

2. **Architecture**
   - API-first approach for data operations
   - Configuration-based API connection
   - Component-based UI structure

### Future Decision Points

1. **State Management**
   - Evaluate needs for global state management
   - Consider options for client-side caching
   - Determine persistence strategy for user preferences

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
   - Optimize API communication patterns

3. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Gather feedback on most valuable features
   - Adjust roadmap based on user needs
   - Consider phased rollout of complex features
