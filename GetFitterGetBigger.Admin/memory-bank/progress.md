   - Search and filtering
   - Media attachment

2. **Workout Builder**
   - Exercise selection and sequencing
   - Set/rep/rest configuration
   - Workout templates
   - Validation

3. **Training Plan Composer**
   - Calendar-based workout assignment
   - Plan templates
   - Client assignment
   - Progress tracking

4. **Client Management**

## Known Issues

- ~~Tailwind CSS build process issue~~ (RESOLVED): Fixed issue with PostCSS plugin by updating to use Tailwind CLI directly
- Project is following standard Blazor patterns and practices
- Browser testing limitations: The embedded browser in the development environment may not fully render all UI elements. For comprehensive testing, use a standard browser and provide feedback on any issues.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Blazor selected for its C# integration and component model
   - .NET 9.0 chosen as the latest stable platform
   - Tailwind CSS identified as the styling framework
   - Tailwind CSS build process updated to use CLI directly instead of PostCSS plugin

2. **Architecture**
   - API-first approach for data operations
   - Configuration-based API connection
   - Component-based UI structure

### Future Decision Points

1. **State Management**
   - Evaluate needs for global state management
   - Consider options for client-side caching
   - Determine persistence strategy for user preferences

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
   - Optimize API communication patterns

3. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Gather feedback on most valuable features
   - Adjust roadmap based on user needs
   - Consider phased rollout of complex features
