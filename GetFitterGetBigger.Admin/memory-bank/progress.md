# Project Progress

## Current Status

The GetFitterGetBigger Admin Application is in the **initial setup phase**. The project has been created with the basic Blazor template and structure, but specific functionality for the fitness training management has not yet been implemented.

### Project Timeline

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Project Initialization | ‚úÖ Complete | Basic Blazor project structure created |
| Architecture Definition | ‚úÖ Complete | System architecture and patterns documented |
| Tailwind CSS Integration | üîÑ Planned | Setup and configuration of Tailwind CSS |
| API Communication | üîÑ Planned | Implementation of API service layer |
| Core Features | ‚è≥ Not Started | Exercise, workout, and plan management |
| Authentication | ‚è≥ Not Started | User authentication and authorization |
| Deployment | ‚è≥ Not Started | Production deployment |

## What Works

1. **Basic Application Structure**
   - Project compiles and runs
   - Default Blazor routing is functional
   - Sample pages demonstrate basic functionality

2. **Configuration Framework**
   - appsettings.json files are in place
   - Environment-specific configuration is supported

## What's Left to Build

### Foundation Components

1. **Tailwind CSS Integration [NEW]**
   - Install and configure Tailwind CSS
   - Set up build process
   - Create base component styles

2. **API Communication Layer**
   - Configuration-based API connection
   - Service interfaces for data operations
   - Error handling and retry logic

3. **Authentication**
   - User login/logout
   - Role-based authorization
   - Secure API communication

### Core Features

1. **Exercise Management**
   - Exercise creation and editing
   - Categorization and tagging
   - Search and filtering
   - Media attachment

2. **Workout Builder**
   - Exercise selection and sequencing
   - Set/rep/rest configuration
   - Workout templates
   - Validation

3. **Training Plan Composer**
   - Calendar-based workout assignment
   - Plan templates
   - Client assignment
   - Progress tracking

4. **Client Management**
   - Client profiles
   - Assignment of training plans
   - Progress monitoring
   - Communication tools

### Additional Features

1. **Reporting**
   - Usage statistics
   - Client progress reports
   - Workout effectiveness analysis

2. **Template Library**
   - Predefined workout templates
   - Sharing and importing templates
   - Rating and feedback

## Known Issues

- No significant issues at this early stage
- Project is following standard Blazor patterns and practices

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Blazor selected for its C# integration and component model
   - .NET 9.0 chosen as the latest stable platform
   - Tailwind CSS identified as the styling framework

2. **Architecture**
   - API-first approach for data operations
   - Configuration-based API connection
   - Component-based UI structure

### Future Decision Points

1. **State Management**
   - Evaluate needs for global state management
   - Consider options for client-side caching
   - Determine persistence strategy for user preferences

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
   - Optimize API communication patterns

3. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Gather feedback on most valuable features
   - Adjust roadmap based on user needs
   - Consider phased rollout of complex features
