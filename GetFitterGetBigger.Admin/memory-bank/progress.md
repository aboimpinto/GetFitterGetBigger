   - Fixed build process issues with PostCSS plugin
   - Created documentation for troubleshooting Tailwind integration

4. **Dashboard UI**
   - Modern admin dashboard implemented
   - Responsive layout for different screen sizes
   - Key metrics and quick actions displayed
   - Navigation sidebar with main sections

5. **HTTPS in Development**
   - HTTPS enabled by default in development environment
   - HSTS configured for all environments
   - Development certificate configuration in place
   - Comprehensive documentation created for setup and troubleshooting

## Proposed Features

### ReferenceDataService with Caching

To provide a centralized and efficient way to access API reference data, a new service will be created.

*   **Architecture:**
    1.  **Interface (`IReferenceDataService`):** Defines the contract for the service, with methods like `Task<IEnumerable<ReferenceDataDto>> GetDifficultyLevelsAsync()`.
    2.  **Implementation (`ReferenceDataService`):** A class that implements the interface.
    3.  **Dependency Injection:** The service will be registered as a **singleton** in `Program.cs` to ensure a single instance handles the cache for all components and users.

*   **Client-Side Caching:** The service will implement a robust client-side cache to minimize network requests to the API.
    *   **Mechanism:** It will use `IMemoryCache` for in-memory storage of reference table data.
    *   **Dual Invalidation Strategy:**
        1.  **Time-Based Expiration:** Each cached item will have an expiration time based on its volatility (e.g., 24 hours for static data like `BodyParts`, 30 minutes for dynamic data like `Equipment`).
        2.  **Explicit Refresh:** The `IReferenceDataService` will expose a public method (e.g., `Task InvalidateCacheAsync(string key)`) that can be triggered by a UI element, such as a "Refresh Data" button, to force a fetch of the latest data from the API.

## New Tasks

*   **Task:** Implement ReferenceDataService with Caching
    *   **Description:** Implement the `IReferenceDataService` and `ReferenceDataService` as outlined in the "Proposed Features" section. This includes setting up the singleton registration, implementing the caching logic with `IMemoryCache`, and providing methods for both time-based and explicit cache invalidation.
    *   **Status:** `[SUBMITTED]`

## What's Left to Build

### Foundation Components

1. **API Communication Layer**
   - Configuration-based API connection
   - Service interfaces for data operations
   - Error handling and retry logic

2. **~~Authentication~~ (IMPLEMENTED)**
   - ‚úÖ Google and Facebook authentication
   - ‚úÖ User login/logout functionality
   - ‚úÖ Authorization policies
   - ‚úÖ Secure routes with automatic redirection to login
   - ‚úÖ User profile display with email and profile picture

### Core Features

   - Exercise creation and editing
   - Categorization and tagging
   - Search and filtering
   - Media attachment

2. **Workout Builder**
   - Exercise selection and sequencing
   - Set/rep/rest configuration
   - Workout templates
   - Validation

3. **Training Plan Composer**
   - Calendar-based workout assignment
   - Plan templates
   - Client assignment
   - Progress tracking

4. **Client Management**
   - Client profiles
   - Assignment of training plans
   - Progress monitoring
   - Communication tools

### Additional Features

1. **Reporting**
   - Usage statistics
   - Client progress reports
   - Workout effectiveness analysis

2. **Template Library**
   - Predefined workout templates
   - Sharing and importing templates
   - Rating and feedback

## Known Issues

- ~~Tailwind CSS build process issue~~ (RESOLVED): Fixed issue with PostCSS plugin by updating to use Tailwind CLI directly
- Project is following standard Blazor patterns and practices
- Browser testing limitations: The embedded browser in the development environment may not fully render all UI elements. For comprehensive testing, use a standard browser and provide feedback on any issues.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Blazor selected for its C# integration and component model
   - .NET 9.0 chosen as the latest stable platform
   - Tailwind CSS identified as the styling framework
   - Tailwind CSS build process updated to use CLI directly instead of PostCSS plugin

2. **Architecture**
   - API-first approach for data operations
   - Configuration-based API connection
   - Component-based UI structure

### Future Decision Points

1. **State Management**
   - Evaluate needs for global state management
   - Consider options for client-side caching
   - Determine persistence strategy for user preferences

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
   - Optimize API communication patterns

3. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Gather feedback on most valuable features
   - Adjust roadmap based on user needs
   - Consider phased rollout of complex features
