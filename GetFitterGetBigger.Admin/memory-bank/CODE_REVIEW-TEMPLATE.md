- [ ] **Consistent Patterns**: Same patterns used throughout
- [ ] **No Architectural Debt**: No shortcuts taken

**Overall Assessment**: [PASS/FAIL with explanation]

### 2. Code Quality Standards Compliance ⚠️ CRITICAL
Review against CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md:

#### Core Principles
- [ ] Pattern matching used consistently
- [ ] Empty/Null Object Pattern throughout
- [ ] No defensive programming without justification
- [ ] Methods are short and focused

#### Implementation Standards
- [ ] No fake async
- [ ] Proper exception handling
- [ ] Migration strategy followed

**Compliance Score**: X/10

### 3. Testing Coverage
- [ ] **Unit Test Coverage**: X% (target: >80%)
- [ ] **Integration Test Coverage**: All endpoints tested
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Covered in tests
- [ ] **Test Quality**: No magic strings, proper mocking

**Overall Assessment**: [PASS/FAIL with metrics]

### 4. Performance Review
- [ ] **Caching**: Implemented where appropriate
