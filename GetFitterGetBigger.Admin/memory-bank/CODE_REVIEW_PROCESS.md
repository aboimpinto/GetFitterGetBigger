# Code Review Process - GetFitterGetBigger Ecosystem

**🎯 PURPOSE**: Unified code review process applicable across all GetFitterGetBigger projects (API, Admin, Clients). This document defines the mandatory code review standards and processes for ensuring code quality and consistency.

## 📋 Overview

Code reviews are **mandatory quality gates** in our development process. Every feature implementation must pass through systematic code reviews at defined checkpoints before proceeding to the next stage.

## 🔄 Review Process Flow

### 1. **Category-Level Reviews** (During Development)
Each feature is broken down into implementation categories. After completing each category:
- Developer creates a code review using the category template
- Review must achieve APPROVED status before proceeding
- REQUIRES_CHANGES blocks progress until issues are resolved

### 2. **Final Feature Review** (Before Completion)
When all categories are implemented:
- Comprehensive review of the entire feature
- Verifies all previous review issues are resolved
- Checks cross-cutting concerns and integration points
- Required for feature to move to COMPLETED status

## 📊 Review Outcomes

Every code review results in one of three outcomes:

### ✅ **APPROVED**
- Code meets all quality standards
- No issues found
- Can proceed to next stage

### ⚠️ **APPROVED_WITH_NOTES**
- Code is acceptable but has minor issues
- Notes provided for future improvements
- Can proceed but should address notes when possible

### ❌ **REQUIRES_CHANGES**
- Critical issues found that must be fixed
- Blocks progress until resolved
- New review required after fixes

## 🏕️ Boy Scout Rule Implementation

### Leave Code Better Than You Found It
When reviewing modified files (status `M` in git), reviewers must:

1. **Review ALL code in the file**, not just changed lines
2. **Document pre-existing issues** found in unchanged code
3. **Categorize findings** by severity and effort required
4. **Help teams decide** what to fix now vs. defer

### Boy Scout Rule Section Template
```markdown
## 🏕️ Boy Scout Rule - Additional Issues Found

### [FileName.cs]
Since this file was modified, here are additional issues found:

1. **[Method Name]** - [Issue type]
   - ❌ Current: [Description of current implementation]
   - ✅ Should be: [Description of correct implementation]
   - **Impact**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Why this matters]
   - **Effort**: [Time estimate, e.g., ~30 minutes]
   - **Recommendation**: [Fix now/Create tech debt ticket/Document only]

**Team Decision**:
- [ ] Fix in this PR (recommended for consistency)
- [ ] Create separate tech debt ticket
- [ ] Document for future cleanup
```

### Decision Guidelines
- **Fix Now**: Small fixes (<1 hour) that improve consistency
- **Tech Debt Ticket**: Larger refactoring or risky changes
- **Document Only**: Low-impact style issues

## 🎯 Review Focus Areas

### Universal (All Projects)
1. **Code Quality**
   - Readability and maintainability
   - Proper naming conventions
   - Method size and complexity
   - DRY principle adherence
   - **Boy Scout Rule**: Check all methods in modified files

2. **Architecture Compliance**
   - Follows project architecture patterns
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Dependency management

3. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error handling approach
   - Appropriate exception usage
   - Error propagation patterns

4. **Testing**
   - Test coverage for new code
   - Test quality and assertions
   - Test naming and organization

5. **Documentation**
   - Code comments where needed
   - API documentation
   - README updates

### Project-Specific Additions
Each project type should extend reviews with specific concerns:
- **API**: HTTP status codes, REST conventions, DTOs
- **Admin**: Blazor patterns, component lifecycle, state management
- **Clients**: Platform-specific patterns, UI/UX consistency

## 🚀 Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Self-review first**: Review your own code before formal review
2. **Small, focused changes**: Easier to review thoroughly
3. **Address feedback promptly**: Don't let reviews block progress
4. **Learn from reviews**: Apply feedback to future work

### For Code Reviews
1. **Be constructive**: Focus on the code, not the coder
2. **Provide examples**: Show how to fix issues
3. **Prioritize issues**: Distinguish critical from nice-to-have
4. **Document patterns**: Use reviews to establish best practices

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

1. **Review the reviews**: Periodically assess the review process
2. **Update templates**: Evolve based on common issues
3. **Share learnings**: Document patterns and anti-patterns discovered
4. **Automate checks**: Move repetitive checks to automated tools where possible

Remember: Code reviews are about **improving code quality** and **sharing knowledge**, not finding fault. Every review is an opportunity to learn and improve the codebase.
