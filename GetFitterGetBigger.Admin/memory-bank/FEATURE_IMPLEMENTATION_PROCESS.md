# Feature Implementation Process - Admin Project

This document outlines the standard process for implementing new features in the GetFitterGetBigger Admin web application.

## Process Overview

### 0. Feature States (Pre-Implementation)
Features progress through these workflow states:
- **0-SUBMITTED**: Features propagated from API, needs project-specific refinement
- **1-READY_TO_DEVELOP**: Feature refined with tasks and ready to implement
- **2-IN_PROGRESS**: Feature currently being implemented
- **3-COMPLETED**: Feature done and tested
- **4-BLOCKED**: Dependencies preventing progress
- **5-SKIPPED**: Feature deferred or cancelled

#### Working with 0-SUBMITTED Features
When a feature arrives in `0-SUBMITTED` from API propagation:
1. Review the API contract and changes
2. Analyze impact on Admin UI/UX
3. Create implementation tasks specific to Admin project
4. Add time estimates
5. Move to `1-READY_TO_DEVELOP` when the team is ready

### 1. Feature Analysis & Planning
- Feature MUST already exist in `0-SUBMITTED` state
- Review feature requirements from `feature-description.md`
- Analyze UI/UX implications for Admin interface
- Create a comprehensive implementation plan with granular tasks
- **MANDATORY**: Create `feature-tasks.md` in the existing feature folder
- Each task must be marked with status `[ReadyToDevelop]`
- Move feature folder from `0-SUBMITTED` to `1-READY_TO_DEVELOP`
- Tasks should be specific, actionable, and independently verifiable
- The task file must include:
  - Feature branch name at the top
  - Tasks organized by logical categories (Components, Services, State Management, API Integration, etc.)
  - **Unit/Component test tasks immediately following each implementation task**
  - Clear description of what each task entails
  - Space for commit hashes to be added as tasks are completed

### 2. Branch Creation
- Create a dedicated feature branch from master
- Naming convention: `feature/[descriptive-feature-name]`
- All development work occurs in this isolated branch

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Execute tasks sequentially from the task tracking file
- **For EVERY task implementation:**
  1. Update task status to `[InProgress: Started: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` when starting
  2. Write the implementation code
  3. **MANDATORY: Write unit/component tests for the implemented code in the immediately following task**
  4. **MANDATORY: Keep build warnings to a minimum** (address TypeScript errors, unused variables, etc.)
  5. **MANDATORY: Run `npm run build` to ensure compilation succeeds with minimal warnings**
  6. **MANDATORY: Run `npm test` to ensure ALL tests pass (100% green)**
  7. **MANDATORY: Run `npm run lint` to ensure code follows project standards**
  8. Only after build succeeds and ALL tests pass, commit the changes
  9. Update the task status to `[Implemented: <hash> | Started: <timestamp> | Finished: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Duration: Xh Ym]`
- **For EVERY checkpoint:**
  1. Run `npm run build` - BUILD MUST BE SUCCESSFUL (no errors)
  2. Run `npm test` - ALL TESTS MUST BE GREEN (no failures)
  3. Verify no build warnings exist
  4. **MANDATORY: Update checkpoint status from ðŸ›‘ to âœ… when all conditions pass**
- Follow existing React patterns and conventions
- Use existing UI components and design system
- The task tracking file serves as both documentation and audit trail
- **CRITICAL RULES**:
  - **NO broken builds between tasks** - each task must leave the application in a working state
  - **ALL tests must be green** after implementing a task (no skipped, no failures)
  - **Tests are written immediately after implementation** (not deferred to a later phase)
  - Never move to the next task if:
    - The build is failing
    - Build warnings are excessive
    - Tests are not written
    - Any test is failing
    - Linting errors exist

### 4. Test Development & Handling
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Write component tests for all React components
- Write integration tests for API interactions
- If a test requires complex mocking or setup:
  - Create a `[BUG: <detailed-reason>]` entry
  - Mark test with skip attribute
  - Include bug reference in test comment
  - Example: `test.skip('BUG-001: Complex API mocking requires additional setup')`

### 5. Manual Testing Phase (DEFAULT BEHAVIOR)
- After all implementation tasks are complete
- Provide user with:
  - Detailed step-by-step testing instructions
  - Test scenarios covering all user flows
  - Expected UI behaviors and responses
  - Sample data for testing
- Wait for user acceptance before proceeding

### 6. Feature Finalization
After user explicitly states feature acceptance:
1. Create descriptive commit message summarizing all changes
2. Push feature branch to remote repository
3. Merge feature branch into master locally
4. **MANDATORY: Push the merged master branch to remote repository**
5. Delete the feature branch locally
6. Optionally delete the feature branch on remote

### 7. Special Conditions
- **Skipping Manual Tests**: Only when user explicitly requests during initial feature specification
- **Interrupted Implementation**: Next session can resume using existing task list with current statuses
- **Git Operations**: All git operations require explicit user approval and are not automated

## Task Status Definitions
- `[ReadyToDevelop]` - Task identified and ready to implement
- `[InProgress: Started: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` - Task currently being worked on with start timestamp
- `[Implemented: <hash> | Started: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Finished: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Duration: Xh Ym]` - Task completed with timing data
- `[BUG: <reason>]` - Known issue requiring future resolution
- `[Skipped]` - Task deferred or determined unnecessary
- `[INCOMPLETE: <reason>]` - Task cannot be completed due to external dependency or bug
- `[BLOCKED: BUG-<id>]` - Task blocked by a specific bug that needs to be fixed first

## Important Notes
- This process ensures code quality through comprehensive testing
- User maintains control over deployment and merge decisions
- Clear audit trail through commit hashes and bug tracking
- Supports both continuous and interrupted development workflows

## Handling Blocked Features
When a feature cannot be completed due to external dependencies:
1. Mark the blocking task as `[BLOCKED: BUG-<id>]` with reference to the bug
2. Create a bug entry in the appropriate tracking location with:
   - Bug ID and description
   - Link back to the blocked feature task
   - Expected resolution approach
3. Mark the overall feature as `[INCOMPLETE]` at the end of the feature file
4. When the bug is fixed:
   - Update the blocked task to `[Implemented: <hash>]`
   - Remove the `[INCOMPLETE]` status from the feature
   - Add note about bug resolution

## Time Tracking Summary
- **Total Estimated Time:** [Sum of all estimates]
- **Total Actual Time:** [To be calculated from task durations]
- **AI Assistance Impact:** [% reduction in time]
- **Implementation Started:** [First task start time]
- **Implementation Completed:** [Last task finish time]

## Notes
- Each implementation task must be immediately followed by its test task
- No task is complete until build passes and all tests are green
- Keep build warnings to minimum
- Follow existing UI patterns and component library
- Time estimates are for a developer without AI assistance
```

## Example Task Status Updates

- `[ReadyToDevelop]` - Initial status for all tasks
- `[InProgress: Started: 2025-01-15 14:30]` - Task being actively worked on
- `[Implemented: a1b2c3d4 | Started: 2025-01-15 14:30 | Finished: 2025-01-15 15:15 | Duration: 0h 45m]` - Completed task
- `[BUG: Complex mock setup for API service]` - Known issue to be addressed later
- `[Skipped]` - Task determined unnecessary during implementation

## Time Calculation Guidelines

### Recording Time
- Use 24-hour format for timestamps (HH:MM)
- Record actual work time only (exclude breaks, interruptions)
- If a task spans multiple days, sum up the actual work duration
- Round to nearest 5-minute increment for consistency

### Duration Calculation
- Format: `Xh Ym` (e.g., "2h 30m", "0h 45m", "4h 0m")
- For tasks interrupted and resumed:
  - Track each work session
  - Sum total actual work time
  - Note in task if it was interrupted

### Example with Interruption
```
Task 3.1: Create UserProfile component 
[Implemented: abc123 | Started: 2025-01-15 09:00 | Finished: 2025-01-16 11:30 | Duration: 3h 15m]
Note: Work sessions: Jan 15 (09:00-10:30), Jan 16 (10:00-11:30)
```

### AI Impact Calculation
At feature completion, calculate:
- Sum all estimated times
- Sum all actual durations
- AI Impact = ((Estimated - Actual) / Estimated) Ã— 100%
- Document any factors that affected the comparison

## Admin-Specific Considerations

### UI/UX Standards
- Follow existing Tailwind CSS patterns
- Use existing component library
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Test on different screen sizes

### API Integration
- Use centralized API service
- Handle authentication tokens properly
- Implement proper error handling
- Show loading states during API calls

### State Management
- Use existing state management pattern (Redux/Context)
- Keep state normalized
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

### Performance
- Implement code splitting for large features
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Lazy load images and heavy components
- Implement proper pagination for lists
