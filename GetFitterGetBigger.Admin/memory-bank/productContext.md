# Product Context

## Problem Statement

In the fitness industry, Personal Trainers (PTs) face several challenges when managing their clients' training programs:

1. **Communication Gap**: Traditional methods of sharing workout plans (paper, generic apps, spreadsheets) create distance between PTs and clients
2. **Time Consumption**: Creating personalized workout plans for multiple clients is time-intensive
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring client adherence and progress across multiple platforms is difficult
4. **Consistency**: Maintaining consistent quality and structure across different client programs is challenging
