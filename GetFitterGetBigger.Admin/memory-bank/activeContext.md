# Active Context

This file provides a high-level overview of the current state of the GetFitterGetBigger Admin Application. For detailed information about specific features, please refer to the feature documentation in the `memory-bank/features/` directory.

## Current Work Focus

The GetFitterGetBigger Admin Application is in the initial setup and architecture phase. The focus is on establishing the foundational structure and key integrations before implementing specific features.

### Active Development Areas

1. **API Configuration** - [Details](/memory-bank/features/api-configuration/overview.md)
   - Setting up the configuration-based API connection
   - Establishing patterns for endpoint composition
   - Creating the service layer for API communication

2. **Core Models**
   - Defining data models for exercises, workouts, and plans
   - Creating DTOs for API communication
   - Implementing validation logic

## Recent Changes

1. **Authentication** - [Details](/memory-bank/features/authentication/overview.md)
   - Implemented Google and Facebook authentication
   - Set up authorization policies
   - Created login/logout functionality
   - Added user profile display

2. **Tailwind CSS Integration** - [Details](/memory-bank/features/tailwind-css/overview.md)
   - Installed and configured Tailwind CSS
   - Set up build process for CSS generation
   - Fixed build process issues and documented solutions

3. **HTTPS in Development** - [Details](/memory-bank/features/https-development/overview.md)
   - Configured HTTPS profile as default in launchSettings.json
   - Enabled HSTS in development environment
   - Added Kestrel certificate configuration

## Next Priorities

1. **Complete API Configuration** - [Tasks](/memory-bank/features/api-configuration/tasks.md)
   - Implement configuration for API endpoint URL
   - Create service layer for composing endpoint addresses
   - Establish patterns for API communication

2. **Begin Exercise Management** - [Tasks](/memory-bank/features/exercise-management/tasks.md)
   - Define data models for exercises
   - Create exercise list view
   - Implement exercise creation/editing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **API-First Approach**
   - All data operations will go through the API
   - No direct database access from the Admin application
   - Business logic primarily resides in the API layer

2. **Component Structure**
   - UI components will follow a hierarchical structure
   - Reusable components will be created for common patterns
   - State will be managed through services and cascading parameters

3. **Configuration Strategy**
   - Environment-specific configurations in appsettings files
   - API endpoint URL configured centrally
   - Feature flags for progressive implementation

### Design Considerations

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Application must work well on various screen sizes
   - Primary focus on desktop/laptop for admin users
   - Tailwind's responsive utilities will be leveraged

2. **Performance**
   - Minimize initial load time
   - Implement efficient data loading patterns
   - Use pagination for large datasets

3. **User Experience**
   - Create intuitive workflows for content creation
   - Provide immediate feedback for user actions
   - Implement consistent design patterns
