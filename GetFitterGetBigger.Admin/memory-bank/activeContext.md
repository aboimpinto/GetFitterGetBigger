# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The GetFitterGetBigger Admin Application is in the initial setup and architecture phase. The focus is on establishing the foundational structure and key integrations before implementing specific features.

### Active Development Areas

1. **Project Structure**
   - Basic Blazor application structure is in place
   - Default components and pages are set up
   - Core configuration files are established

2. **Tailwind CSS Integration**
   - Integration of Tailwind CSS with Blazor has been completed
   - This establishes the styling foundation for all future UI development
   - Enables consistent design patterns across the application
   - Fixed issues with Tailwind CSS build process and configuration
   - Created documentation for troubleshooting Tailwind integration issues

3. **API Configuration**
   - Setting up the configuration-based API connection
   - Establishing patterns for endpoint composition
   - Creating the service layer for API communication

## Recent Changes

The project has been initialized with the standard Blazor template, which includes:

- Basic project structure
- Default routing
- Sample pages (Home, Counter, Weather)
- Basic layout components

## Next Steps

   - Create service layer for composing endpoint addresses
   - Establish patterns for API communication

4. **Core Models**
   - Define data models for exercises, workouts, and plans
   - Create DTOs for API communication
   - Implement validation logic

### Upcoming Tasks

1. **~~Authentication~~ (IMPLEMENTED)**
   - ✅ Implemented Google and Facebook authentication
   - ✅ Set up authorization policies
   - ✅ Created login/logout functionality
   - ✅ Added user profile display with email and profile picture
   - ✅ Implemented automatic redirection to login for unauthenticated users
   - ✅ Fixed profile picture retrieval from authentication providers
   - ✅ Improved logout functionality with direct endpoint access
   - ✅ Secured authentication credentials using .NET User Secrets
   - ✅ Created documentation for authentication setup and credential management

2. **Exercise Management**
   - Create exercise list view
   - Implement exercise creation/editing
   - Add categorization and filtering

3. **Workout Builder**
   - Design workout builder interface
   - Implement exercise selection and sequencing
   - Create workout templates

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

1. **API-First Approach**
   - All data operations will go through the API
   - No direct database access from the Admin application
   - Business logic primarily resides in the API layer

2. **Component Structure**
   - UI components will follow a hierarchical structure
   - Reusable components will be created for common patterns
   - State will be managed through services and cascading parameters

3. **Configuration Strategy**
   - Environment-specific configurations in appsettings files
   - API endpoint URL configured centrally
   - Feature flags for progressive implementation

### Design Considerations

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Application must work well on various screen sizes
   - Primary focus on desktop/laptop for admin users
   - Tailwind's responsive utilities will be leveraged

2. **Performance**
   - Minimize initial load time
   - Implement efficient data loading patterns
   - Use pagination for large datasets

3. **User Experience**
   - Create intuitive workflows for content creation
   - Provide immediate feedback for user actions
   - Implement consistent design patterns

4. **Testing Approach**
   - If automated browser testing fails twice, request manual testing from the user
   - Collect user feedback on UI/UX issues that may not be visible in automated tests
   - Focus on critical user flows for thorough testing

## Project Insights

### Key Learnings

- Blazor provides a productive environment for C# developers to create web applications
- The component model aligns well with the modular nature of the application
- Tailwind CSS offers flexibility while maintaining design consistency
- Tailwind CSS integration with Blazor requires specific configuration and build process setup
- Proper documentation of technical issues and solutions is essential for future maintenance

### Important Patterns

1. **Service-Based API Communication**
   - Typed HTTP clients for different API areas
   - Interface-based services for testability
   - Consistent error handling

2. **Component Composition**
   - Small, focused components
   - Clear component interfaces (parameters, callbacks)
   - Reusable UI patterns

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment-specific settings
   - Feature flags for progressive rollout
   - Centralized configuration access

4. **Tailwind CSS Integration**
   - Direct use of Tailwind CLI for CSS processing
   - Local CSS file references instead of CDN
   - Proper package versioning and dependency management
   - Documentation of common issues and solutions
