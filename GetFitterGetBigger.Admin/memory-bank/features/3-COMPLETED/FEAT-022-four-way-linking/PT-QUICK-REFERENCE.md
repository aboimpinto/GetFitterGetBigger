# Four-Way Exercise Linking - Quick Reference Guide

*Essential guide for Personal Trainers using the Four-Way Exercise Linking System*

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start (30 seconds)

1. **Open any exercise** from the Exercise List
2. **Scroll to "Exercise Relationships"** section at bottom
3. **Click "Add [Type]"** buttons to create links
4. **Use context tabs** for multi-type exercises (Workout + Warmup)

## 📋 Context Rules Cheat Sheet

| Exercise Type | Can Link To | Cannot Link To |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Workout** | ✅ Warmup, Cooldown, Alternative | ❌ None (full access) |
| **Warmup** | ✅ Workout, Alternative Warmup | ❌ Other Warmup, Cooldown |
| **Cooldown** | ✅ Workout, Alternative Cooldown | ❌ Other Cooldown, Warmup |
| **REST** | ❌ Nothing (shows info message) | ❌ All linking disabled |

## 🎨 Color Code System

| Color | Meaning | Where You'll See It |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 🟢 **Green/Emerald** | Workout exercises | Context headers, workout sections |
| 🟠 **Orange** | Warmup exercises | Warmup sections, warmup context |
| 🔵 **Blue** | Cooldown exercises | Cooldown sections, cooldown context |
| 🟣 **Purple** | Alternative exercises | Alternative sections, alternative cards |
| ⚪ **Gray** | REST/disabled states | REST exercises, disabled buttons |

## ⚡ Link Limits at a Glance

- **Warmup**: 10 maximum per workout
- **Cooldown**: 10 maximum per workout  
- **Alternative**: Unlimited ♾️
- **REST**: Zero (no linking allowed)

## 🔄 Context Switching (Multi-Type Exercises)

**If you see tabs at the top:**
- **"As Workout Exercise"**: Shows warmups, cooldowns, alternatives this exercise uses
- **"As Warmup Exercise"**: Shows workouts that use this + alternative warmups
- **"As Cooldown Exercise"**: Shows workouts that use this + alternative cooldowns

**Pro Tip**: Each context preserves its own relationships - switching won't lose your work!

## 🎯 Alternative Exercise Rules

**✅ Valid Alternative Links:**
- Must share at least one exercise type
- Example: "Push-ups (Workout+Warmup)" ↔ "Modified Push-ups (Workout+Warmup)"

**❌ Invalid Alternative Links:**
- No shared exercise types  
- Example: "Squats (Workout only)" ↔ "Arm Circles (Warmup only)"

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut | Where |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Navigate tabs** | `Tab` key | Context selector |
| **Switch context** | `Enter` or `Space` | On context tab |
| **Move between contexts** | `←` `→` Arrow keys | Context selector |
| **Jump to first/last** | `Home` / `End` | Context selector |
| **Close modal** | `Escape` | Exercise selection modal |
| **Confirm action** | `Enter` | Buttons and dialogs |

## 🚀 Quick Actions

### Add Alternative Exercise (Most Common)
1. **Click "Add Alternative"** (purple section)
2. **Search for exercise** with similar muscle groups
3. **Check compatibility score** (60%+ recommended)
4. **Click exercise card** to add
5. **Both directions added automatically** ✨

### Switch Context for Multi-Type Exercise
1. **Look for tabs** above relationship sections
2. **Click desired context** (e.g., "As Warmup Exercise")
3. **Interface updates** to show appropriate relationships
4. **Original context preserved** when switching back

### Remove Bidirectional Link
1. **Click trash icon** on alternative exercise card
2. **Dialog warns**: "This will remove the bidirectional relationship"
3. **Click "Remove"** to confirm
4. **Both directions removed** automatically

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Fast Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| **"No exercises found"** | Try broader search terms, check exercise types |
| **Can't add warmup to warmup** | Switch to Workout context or choose Alternative |
| **Changes not saving** | Check internet connection, refresh page |
| **Modal won't open** | Refresh page, check browser console |
| **Links disappeared** | Switch between contexts - they may be in different context |

## 📱 Mobile Tips

- **Modal selection**: Exercise selection now uses overlay modal (no scrolling needed)
- **Touch targets**: All buttons sized for finger taps
- **Swipe-friendly**: Natural scrolling in exercise lists
- **Context tabs**: Large enough for easy touch selection

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **Alternative links are bidirectional**: Adding A→B also creates B→A
2. **Context switching preserves data**: Your links won't disappear when switching contexts
3. **REST exercises can't link**: System shows info message instead of linking options
4. **10-link limit**: Only applies to warmup/cooldown, NOT alternatives
5. **Type compatibility required**: Alternative exercises must share exercise types

## 🎯 Best Practices (30-Second Version)

1. **Start with warmups/cooldowns** for workout exercises (traditional flow)
2. **Add alternatives** for exercise variations and progressions
3. **Use context switching** to see how exercises are used in different roles
4. **Check compatibility scores** before adding alternatives (aim for 60%+)
5. **Review regularly** and remove outdated relationships

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. **Hover tooltips**: Most icons have helpful explanations
2. **Error messages**: Red messages provide specific guidance
3. **Success notifications**: Green messages confirm actions completed
4. **Full documentation**: Available in user documentation file for complete details

## 🎉 Power User Tips

- **Compatibility scoring**: 60% = good match, 30% = acceptable, 10% = minimal overlap
- **Search performance**: Use specific terms for faster results in large exercise lists
- **Context strategy**: Build warmup/cooldown relationships first, then add alternatives
- **Batch planning**: Plan related exercises together (same muscle groups, equipment)
