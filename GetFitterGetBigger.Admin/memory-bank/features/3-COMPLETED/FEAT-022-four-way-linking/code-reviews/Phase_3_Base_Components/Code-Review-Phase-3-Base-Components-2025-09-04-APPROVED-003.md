### ✅ Compatibility Scoring Algorithm
```csharp
// Verified implementation:
var typeScore = CalculateTypeOverlap(exercise1, exercise2) * 0.6;  // 60% weight
var muscleScore = CalculateMuscleOverlap(exercise1, exercise2) * 0.3; // 30% weight
var difficultyScore = CalculateDifficultyProximity(exercise1, exercise2) * 0.1; // 10% weight
var totalScore = typeScore + muscleScore + difficultyScore;
```
- Mathematical accuracy: ✅ Verified
- Edge cases: ✅ Handled
- Performance: ✅ Optimized

### ✅ Context Switching
- Multi-type exercise detection: ✅ Automatic
- Tab interface: ✅ Conditionally displayed
