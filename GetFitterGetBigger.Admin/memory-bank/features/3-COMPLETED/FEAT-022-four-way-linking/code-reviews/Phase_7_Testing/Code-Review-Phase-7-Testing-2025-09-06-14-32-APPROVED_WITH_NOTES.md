## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None identified. All build warnings have been resolved and all tests are passing.

## Major Issues (Should Fix)
None identified. The code demonstrates solid architecture and implementation quality.

## Minor Issues & Suggestions

### 1. Consistent Null-Conditional Operator Usage
**Location**: Multiple components
**Issue**: While null checks are properly implemented, some areas could benefit from more consistent use of null-conditional operators for brevity.
**Impact**: Low - Code readability improvement
**Recommendation**: Consider standardizing null-conditional operator usage in conditional rendering scenarios.

### 2. Performance Monitoring Enhancement
**Location**: FourWayLinkedExercisesList.razor
**Issue**: While ShouldRender optimization is excellent, additional performance monitoring could be valuable for large datasets.
**Impact**: Low - Future scalability consideration
**Recommendation**: Consider implementing performance telemetry for render cycles in production.
