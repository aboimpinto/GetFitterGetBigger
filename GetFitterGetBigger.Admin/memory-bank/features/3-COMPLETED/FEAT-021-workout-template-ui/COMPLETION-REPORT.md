*Completed concurrently with Phase 1

## Placeholders & Future Work

### Implemented Placeholders
1. **Equipment Information**: "Coming soon" message due to API limitations
2. **Exercise Suggestions**: Feature hidden, postponed for future release
3. **Exercise Management UI**: Read-only display, editing via API only

### Future Enhancements
- Equipment aggregation when API supports it
- AI-powered exercise suggestions
- In-app exercise management
- Advanced statistics and analytics
- Mobile-responsive design improvements

## Quality Assurance

### Manual Testing
- Comprehensive testing guide created
- All test scenarios executed successfully
- User acceptance received: 2025-07-25 21:55
- No critical issues found

### Automated Testing
- 352 tests ensure reliability
- All components have test coverage
- Integration tests verify workflows
- State management thoroughly tested

## Lessons Learned

### Successes
1. **Rapid Development**: AI assistance dramatically reduced development time
2. **Quality Maintained**: Despite speed, code quality and testing standards upheld
3. **Pattern Reuse**: Existing patterns accelerated new component development
4. **User Experience**: Auto-save and recovery features enhance usability

### Challenges
