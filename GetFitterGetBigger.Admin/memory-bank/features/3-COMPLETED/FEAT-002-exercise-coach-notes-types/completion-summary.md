## Key Achievements

### 1. Coach Notes Array Implementation

- Implemented complex validation rules:
  - At least one type must be selected
  - Rest type is mutually exclusive

- Rest type automatically disables equipment, muscle groups, movement patterns, and body parts
- Rest type auto-sets difficulty to "Beginner"

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements
- Created reusable `ExerciseTypeBadge` component with color coding and emojis
- Enhanced `CoachNotesEditor` with drag-and-drop style reordering
- Added comprehensive tooltips and visual feedback
- Implemented responsive design for mobile devices
- Visual indicators for exercise types in lists and details

### 4. Testing Coverage
- All 184 tests passing
- Created comprehensive integration tests
- Fixed all test issues related to UI changes
- Maintained 55.26% line coverage

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created/Modified
1. `CoachNotesEditor.razor` - Full-featured editor for managing coach notes
2. `ExerciseTypeSelector.razor` - Smart selector with business rule enforcement
3. `ExerciseTypeBadge.razor` - Reusable badge component for consistent styling
4. Updated `ExerciseForm`, `ExerciseList`, and `ExerciseDetail` components

   - Cannot select all four
   - Rest type auto-configurations

## Known Issues
None - all tests passing and feature fully functional.

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding drag-and-drop for coach notes reordering
- Add rich text support for coach notes
- Enable exercise type filtering in the exercise list

## Migration Notes
- API now uses camelCase field names
