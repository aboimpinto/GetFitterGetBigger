- **Implementation Completed:** 2025-07-12 (user acceptance)

## Technical Notes
- **Framework Compatibility**: All components built for Blazor Server with .NET 9.0
- **Testing Strategy**: Follow COMPREHENSIVE-TESTING-GUIDE.md for bUnit and xUnit patterns
- **State Management**: Leverage existing reference data caching patterns
- **API Integration**: Follow established service patterns with proper error handling
- **UI Consistency**: Match existing Tailwind CSS design system and component patterns
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support throughout
- **Reference Table Integration**: Follow patterns from Equipment and MuscleGroups management

## Dependencies and Prerequisites
- API endpoint /api/exercise-weight-types must be deployed and accessible
- ExerciseWeightTypes reference data seeded in database
- Existing exercise management infrastructure operational
- Current reference data service patterns established
- ExerciseDto must include weight type information from API

## Success Criteria Verification
- [ ] ExerciseWeightType displayed in Reference Tables page (read-only)
- [ ] All 5 weight types selectable in exercise forms (Add/Update)
- [ ] Weight input validation working for each weight type category  
- [ ] Exercise list displays weight type badges and supports filtering/sorting
- [ ] Exercise detail view shows weight type information
- [ ] Bulk operations complete successfully for weight type assignments
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintains full functionality across all screens
- [ ] All accessibility requirements met (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage with all tests passing
- [ ] No build warnings or linting errors
- [ ] Manual testing completed with user acceptance

## Manual Testing & User Acceptance - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

### Task: Manual testing and user acceptance `[Completed: User accepted on 2025-07-12]`
**✅ USER ACCEPTANCE RECEIVED: Feature accepted and ready for COMPLETED status**

Please manually test the following scenarios:

1. **Exercise Creation**:
   - ✅ Create new exercise with weight type selection
   - ✅ Verify REST exercises cannot have weight type
   - ✅ Verify non-REST exercises require weight type

2. **Exercise Editing**:
   - ✅ Edit existing exercise and change weight type
   - ✅ Verify weight type is properly loaded when editing
   - ✅ Test validation when changing exercise type to/from REST

3. **Exercise List**:
   - ✅ Verify weight type badges display correctly
   - ✅ Test weight type filter functionality
   - ✅ Confirm weight types show for all non-REST exercises

4. **Visual Validation**:
   - ✅ Check that required asterisk disappears when weight type is selected
   - ✅ Verify no duplicate labels appear
   - ✅ Test responsive design on different screen sizes

5. **Data Persistence**:
   - ✅ Create exercise, refresh page, verify weight type persists
   - ✅ Update exercise, verify changes are saved

**Status**: All manual tests have been performed and issues found were fixed.

**⚠️ AWAITING USER ACCEPTANCE**: Once you have verified the fixes and are satisfied with the functionality, please provide explicit acceptance (e.g., "Tests passed", "Feature accepted", "Everything looks good") so the feature can be marked as COMPLETED.
