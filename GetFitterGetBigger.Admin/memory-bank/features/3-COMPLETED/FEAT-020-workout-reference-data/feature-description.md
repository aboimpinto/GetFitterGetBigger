# Feature: Workout Reference Data

## Feature ID: FEAT-020
## Created: 2025-07-13
## Completed: 2025-07-21
## Status: COMPLETED
## Source: Features/Workouts/WorkoutTemplate/WorkoutReferenceData/
## Final Effort: 7 hours 5 minutes (0.88 days) - 72.8% reduction from estimate

## Summary
Implementation of UI components for Personal Trainers to browse and understand workout reference data within the Admin application. This feature provides read-only access to workout objectives, categories, and execution protocols to support informed workout template creation and client programming decisions.

## Business Context
This feature addresses the need for standardized workout classification, objective-based training guidance, and execution protocol definitions as defined in the source RAW file at Features/Workouts/WorkoutTemplate/WorkoutReferenceData/README.md.

Personal Trainers require quick access to comprehensive reference information to make professional programming decisions during workout template creation. The reference data provides scientific programming guidance, muscle group targeting information, and methodology explanations that enhance training effectiveness.

## User Stories
As a Personal Trainer:
- I want to view workout objectives with detailed programming guidance so that I can select appropriate training goals for my clients
- I want to browse workout categories with visual organization so that I can categorize workout templates effectively
- I want to understand execution protocols with implementation details so that I can prescribe the most suitable training methodologies
- I want to search and filter reference data so that I can quickly find relevant information during template creation
- I want access to muscle group targeting information so that I can ensure balanced workout programming

## UI/UX Requirements

### Page/Component Structure
The feature integrates into the existing Reference Tables menu structure with three new components:

```
Reference Tables
├── Exercise Weight Types (existing)
├── Difficulty Levels (existing)
├── Body Parts (existing)
├── Workout Objectives (new)
├── Workout Categories (new)
└── Execution Protocols (new)
```

### User Workflows
1. **Reference Consultation Workflow**: Navigate to reference tables during workout template creation to understand available options and programming guidance
2. **Detailed Study Workflow**: Deep dive into specific reference data using modal dialogs with comprehensive information
3. **Quick Lookup Workflow**: Use search and filter functionality to rapidly find specific information
4. **Cross-Reference Workflow**: Compare information across different reference tables to make coherent programming decisions

### Component Design Patterns

#### WorkoutObjectivesComponent
- **Layout**: Card-based list view with search functionality
- **Features**: Search by name/description, expandable detail modals, programming guidance display
- **Visual Design**: Clean cards with objective names, truncated descriptions, and info icons

#### WorkoutCategoriesComponent  
- **Layout**: Visual grid with color-coded category cards
- **Features**: Category filtering, icon display, muscle group information
- **Visual Design**: Icon-based cards using category colors for visual organization

#### ExecutionProtocolsComponent
- **Layout**: Structured table view with filter tabs
- **Features**: Sort by columns, filter by intensity/pattern, detailed methodology modals
- **Visual Design**: Professional table with protocol codes, characteristics, and info icons

### Forms and Validations
- **Search Fields**: No validation required (informational lookup)
- **Filter Controls**: Selection-based, no input validation needed
- **Modal Dialogs**: Read-only display, no form submissions

### Visual Design Notes
- Follow existing reference table component styling and patterns
- Use responsive design optimized for tablet and desktop use
- Implement consistent loading states with skeleton screens
- Provide clear error states with retry mechanisms
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

## Technical Requirements

### API Integration
The feature consumes the following API endpoints:

#### Workout Objectives API
- **GET /api/workout-objectives**: Retrieve all workout objectives
- **GET /api/workout-objectives/{id}**: Get specific objective details
- **Caching**: 1-hour client-side cache
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback with retry mechanism

#### Workout Categories API
- **GET /api/workout-categories**: Retrieve all workout categories  
- **GET /api/workout-categories/{id}**: Get specific category details
- **Visual Assets**: Icon library integration for category icons
- **Color Theming**: Dynamic CSS custom properties for category colors

#### Execution Protocols API
- **GET /api/execution-protocols**: Retrieve all execution protocols
- **GET /api/execution-protocols/{id}**: Get specific protocol details
- **GET /api/execution-protocols/by-code/{code}**: Get protocol by code
- **Filtering**: Client-side filtering for performance

### State Management
- **Reference Data Caching**: Implement client-side caching with 1-hour TTL to match API caching strategy
- **Search State**: Local component state for search queries and filter selections
- **Modal State**: Manage modal open/close state and content loading
- **Error State**: Handle loading, error, and empty states consistently across components

### Component Dependencies
- **Existing Components**: Leverage existing reference table layout and styling patterns
- **UI Libraries**: Use existing UI component library for modals, buttons, and form controls
- **Icon Library**: Integrate with existing icon system for category icons
- **Responsive Framework**: Follow existing responsive design patterns
