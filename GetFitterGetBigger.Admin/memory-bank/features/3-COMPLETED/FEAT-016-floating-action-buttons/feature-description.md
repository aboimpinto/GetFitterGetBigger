## Feature ID: FEAT-016
## Created: 2025-07-04
## Completed: 2025-07-04
## Status: COMPLETED
## Target PI: PI-2025-Q1

## Description
Implement floating action buttons for the Exercise Add/Update form to improve user experience by keeping Save and Cancel buttons always visible without requiring scrolling. The buttons should be positioned responsively - outside the form container on large screens and inside on small screens.

## Business Value
- Improves user experience by eliminating the need to scroll to reach action buttons
- Particularly important for the Update Exercise scenario where forms can be long
- Follows modern UI/UX patterns with floating action buttons
- Enhances accessibility by keeping critical actions always visible

## User Stories
- As a Personal Trainer, I want to save or cancel my exercise edits without scrolling so that I can work more efficiently
- As a Personal Trainer, I want the action buttons to be visually consistent with the form layout so that the interface feels cohesive

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Floating buttons are always visible at the bottom of the viewport
- [ ] Cancel button appears on the bottom left, Save button on the bottom right
- [ ] On large screens (â‰¥1280px), buttons align with the form container edges
- [ ] On small screens, buttons are positioned inside the viewport with appropriate margins
- [ ] Buttons use circular design with icons (X for cancel, floppy disk for save)
- [ ] Text labels appear under the icons
- [ ] Original form buttons at the bottom are removed
- [ ] Buttons maintain proper z-index to stay above other content
- [ ] Save button shows loading state while submitting

## Technical Specifications
- Use CSS classes with media queries (inline styles don't support @media)
- Account for navbar width (16rem) in positioning calculations
- Large screen positioning:
  - Cancel: `left: calc(50% - 25rem)`
  - Save: `right: calc(50% - 41rem)` (41rem = 25rem + 16rem navbar compensation)
- Small screen positioning:
  - Cancel: `left: 1rem` (default, no media query needed)
  - Save: `right: 1rem` (using Tailwind `right-4`)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling consistency
- Implement in Blazor with InteractiveServer render mode

## Dependencies
- None - this is a UI-only enhancement

## Notes
- Important lesson learned: CSS media queries cannot be used in inline style attributes
- The navbar width must be considered when calculating button positions for visual balance
- The 16rem difference between cancel (25rem) and save (41rem) positioning compensates for the navbar
- Created comprehensive documentation in lessons-learned folder about these discoveries
