## Implementation Notes
- Focus only on Equipment and Muscle Groups for this implementation
- Equipment: Simple name field only
- Muscle Groups: Name field + BodyPart dropdown (loaded from ReferenceDataService)
- Ensure proper authorization checks (PT-Tier) are in place
- Modal should be reusable for future reference table types
- Cache invalidation must update all instances of the dropdown across the app
- Follow existing overlay form patterns from Equipment/MuscleGroup forms
- Maintain form state when modal is opened/closed

## Testing Scenarios for Manual Testing
1. **Equipment Creation**:
   - Open Exercise form
   - Click "+" next to Equipment field
   - Enter new equipment name
   - Save and verify it appears selected
   - Verify it appears in other Exercise forms

2. **Muscle Group Creation**:
   - Open Exercise form
   - Click "+" next to Muscle Groups field
   - Enter name and select body part
   - Save and verify it appears selected
   - Verify it appears in other Exercise forms

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Try to create duplicate equipment
   - Test network failure scenarios
   - Verify form data is preserved

4. **UI/UX**:
   - Test keyboard shortcuts
   - Verify loading states
   - Check mobile responsiveness

## Time Tracking Summary
- **Total Estimated Time:** 16.5 hours
- **Total Actual Time:** [To be calculated from task durations]
- **AI Assistance Impact:** [% reduction in time]
- **Implementation Started:** [First task start time]
- **Implementation Completed:** [Last task finish time]

## Notes
- Each implementation task must be immediately followed by its test task
- No task is complete until build passes and all tests are green
- **CRITICAL: Build must have ZERO errors and ZERO warnings** - fix ALL errors, unused variables, etc.
- If any warnings appear during implementation, they MUST be fixed before proceeding
- Follow existing UI patterns and component library
- Time estimates are for a developer without AI assistance
