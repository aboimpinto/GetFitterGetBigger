## Time Tracking Summary
- **Total Estimated Time:** 4h 30m
- **Total Actual Time:** 2h 15m
- **AI Assistance Impact:** 50% reduction in time
- **Implementation Started:** 2025-07-07 17:57
- **Implementation Completed:** 2025-07-07 19:37
- **Efficiency Gain:** 2h 15m time savings

## Notes
- Each implementation task must be immediately followed by its test task
- No task is complete until build passes and all tests are green
- Keep build warnings to minimum
- Follow existing patterns for reference data implementation (similar to Difficulty Level)
- Ensure C# types are properly updated throughout
- Handle null cases for backwards compatibility with existing exercises
- Use Blazor component patterns and lifecycle methods

## Implementation Patterns to Follow
1. Use the same Blazor component and service patterns as Difficulty Level
2. Implement caching for kinetic chain types (24-hour cache)
3. Use the EnhancedReferenceSelect Blazor component for the dropdown
4. Follow the conditional validation pattern from REST exercises
5. Ensure proper null-safe display in lists and details
6. Use dependency injection for services
7. Follow Blazor parameter and event callback patterns

## Validation Rules Summary
- Non-REST exercises: Kinetic Chain is REQUIRED
- REST exercises: Kinetic Chain must be NULL/cleared
- Error messages must be clear and specific
