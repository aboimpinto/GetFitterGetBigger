Equipment Management Feature for Admin Application

## Overview
Implement full CRUD functionality for managing equipment in the Admin application, allowing Personal Trainers to add, edit, and delete equipment options that can be associated with exercises.

## User Stories
As a Personal Trainer, I want to:
- View all available equipment in a list
- Add new equipment items
- Edit existing equipment names
- Delete equipment that is no longer needed
- See which exercises use specific equipment

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Equipment list page displays all active equipment
- [ ] Search/filter functionality for equipment list
- [ ] Add equipment form with name validation
- [ ] Edit equipment form pre-populated with current data
- [ ] Delete confirmation dialog
- [ ] Proper error handling for all operations
- [ ] Success notifications after operations
- [ ] Prevent deletion of equipment in use by exercises
- [ ] Real-time validation for duplicate names

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Integrate with Equipment CRUD API endpoints
- [ ] Implement local state management for equipment list
- [ ] Add caching mechanism for performance
- [ ] Handle all error scenarios from API
- [ ] Follow existing UI/UX patterns in Admin app
- [ ] Add appropriate loading states
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates with rollback

## API Endpoints
- GET `/api/ReferenceTables/Equipment`
- POST `/api/ReferenceTables/Equipment`
- PUT `/api/ReferenceTables/Equipment/{id}`
- DELETE `/api/ReferenceTables/Equipment/{id}`

## Dependencies
- Requires PT-Tier or Admin-Tier authorization
- API documentation in feature-description.md

## UI Components Needed
1. Equipment list view with table/grid
2. Add/Edit equipment modal or page
3. Delete confirmation modal
4. Search/filter controls
5. Loading spinners
6. Error/success notifications

## Estimated Effort
- Frontend implementation: 8-12 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- Total: 10-15 hours

## Notes
- Equipment uses soft delete on the backend
- Names must be unique (case-insensitive)
- Consider adding bulk operations in future iterations
