## Notes
- Coach notes must maintain their order (0-based indexing)
- Coach notes should be deletable and auto-resequence order after deletion
- Rest exercise type cannot be combined with other types but CAN be unselected
- Every exercise must have at least one type (except temporarily during selection)
- No exercise can have all four types
- **Rest Type Business Rules:**
  - When Rest is selected: automatically disable/clear Equipment, Muscle Groups, Movement Patterns, Body Parts
  - When Rest is selected: automatically set Difficulty to "Beginner" and make it read-only
  - Muscle groups should be optional (not required) for exercise creation
  - Coach notes are still allowed for Rest exercises
  - IsActive flag is still user-controlled for Rest exercises
- All API fields now use camelCase naming convention
- Each implementation task must be immediately followed by its test task
- Follow existing Blazor patterns and Tailwind CSS styling
- **FontAwesome Issue**: FontAwesome CSS library is not loaded in the project, causing icons (fas fa-*) to not display. Components use Unicode symbols instead (‚Üí, ‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚úï, üìù) for better visibility and compatibility.
## Boy Scout Rule (Applied during Phase 1):
- Implement Builder pattern for all Exercise DTOs `[Implemented: 223fc351]`
- Enhance builders with bulk operations support `[Implemented: 50457414]`
- Move builders from test to production code `[Implemented: 14d748af]`
