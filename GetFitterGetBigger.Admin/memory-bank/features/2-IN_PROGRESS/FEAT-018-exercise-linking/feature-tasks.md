- This feature depends on API FEAT-022 being deployed and accessible
- Exercise linking is only available for "Workout" type exercises as source
- Maximum 10 warmup and 10 cooldown links per exercise
- Links are soft-deleted (marked inactive) rather than hard-deleted
- Focus on responsive design as PTs may use tablets in the gym
- All validation should provide clear, actionable error messages

## Implementation Dependencies
1. ExerciseDto must be updated to support link indicators
2. ExerciseDetails page must be modified to show links section
3. ExerciseList must be enhanced with link indicators
4. State management must be extended for links data

## Testing Focus Areas
1. Drag-and-drop functionality across browsers
2. Validation edge cases (circular references, type mismatches)
3. Performance with maximum links (10 warmups + 10 cooldowns)
4. Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions
5. Accessibility with screen readers
