# FEAT-021: Workout Template UI

## Overview
The Workout Template UI feature provides the user interface for Personal Trainers to create and manage workout templates in the GetFitterGetBigger Admin application. This feature focuses on template lifecycle management (creation, editing, state transitions, and archival) and builds upon the API implementation (FEAT-021-workout-template-core). Exercise management within templates will be handled in a separate feature.

## Business Context
Personal Trainers need an intuitive interface to leverage the workout template system, allowing them to create reusable workout blueprints and manage the lifecycle of their training programs. This UI feature enables trainers to create and organize template metadata that can be assigned to multiple clients.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Personal Trainers who create and manage workout templates
- **Secondary**: Admin users who may need to review or moderate templates

## Core UI Requirements

### Template Management Views
1. **Template List View**
   - Grid/table display of all workout templates
   - Filtering by category, objective, difficulty level, and state
   - Search functionality by template name
   - Quick actions (edit, duplicate, archive, delete)
   - State indicators (DRAFT, PRODUCTION, ARCHIVED)
   - Sort by name, created date, last modified

2. **Template Creation/Edit View**
   - Multi-step wizard or single form approach
   - Template metadata section (name, description, category, objective, etc.)
   - Validation feedback
   - Save as draft functionality
   - Preview before publishing

3. **Template Detail View**
   - Read-only view of template structure
   - Quick duplicate action
   - State transition controls

### State Management UI
1. **State Transition Controls**
   - Clear state indicators with icons/colors
   - Confirmation dialogs for state changes
   - Warning messages for destructive actions (DRAFT â†’ PRODUCTION)
   - Disabled transitions with explanatory tooltips

2. **Validation Feedback**
   - Real-time validation as user types
   - Summary of validation errors
   - Clear field-level error messages
   - Progress indicator for template completeness

### User Experience Enhancements
1. **Auto-save Functionality**
   - Periodic auto-save for drafts
   - Visual indicator when saving
   - Recovery from browser crashes

2. **Template Duplication**
   - Quick duplicate with name modification
   - Option to copy as draft or maintain state

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-friendly for on-the-go editing
   - Touch-friendly controls for tablets
   - Consistent experience across devices

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture
1. **Smart Components**
   - WorkoutTemplateListContainer
   - WorkoutTemplateFormContainer
   - WorkoutTemplateDetailContainer

2. **Presentation Components**
   - WorkoutTemplateCard
   - StateTransitionButton

3. **Shared Components**
   - ValidationSummary
   - ConfirmationDialog

### State Management
- Use existing state management pattern (Context/Redux)
- Template list state with pagination
- Form state with validation
- UI state (loading, errors, success messages)

### API Integration
- Integrate with all FEAT-021 API endpoints
- Implement proper error handling
- Loading states for all async operations
- Optimistic updates where appropriate

### Form Validation
- Client-side validation matching API rules
- Async validation for uniqueness checks
- Form dirty state tracking
- Unsaved changes warnings

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core CRUD Operations
1. Template list view with basic filtering
2. Create new template form
3. Edit existing template
4. Delete functionality
5. Basic validation

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. State management UI
2. Template duplication
3. Auto-save functionality
4. Advanced filtering and search

### Phase 3: Polish and Enhancement
1. Responsive design improvements
2. Keyboard navigation
3. Accessibility features
4. Performance optimizations
5. User preference persistence

## Postponed Features (from API Implementation)

### Caching Implementation
- **Status**: Postponed pending FEAT-027 (Domain Entity Caching Architecture)  
- **Impact**: UI should implement loading states and consider client-side caching strategies
- **Note**: Once API caching is implemented, UI can optimize data fetching

### Authorization and Permissions
- **Status**: Authentication exists but fine-grained permissions pending
- **Impact**: UI should prepare for permission-based feature visibility
- **Note**: Currently all PT-Tier users have full access

### Advanced Features Not Yet in API
1. **Template Sharing Marketplace**
   - UI preparation for future template sharing
   - Public/private toggle (currently all templates are private to creator)

2. **AI-Powered Suggestions**
   - Placeholder for future AI integration
   - Current suggestions are rule-based

3. **Performance Analytics**
   - Placeholder for workout completion tracking
   - Template effectiveness metrics

## Integration Considerations

### With Existing Features
- Integrate with existing Reference Table selectors
- Maintain consistent styling with other CRUD interfaces
- Use shared validation components

### Navigation and Routes
- `/workout-templates` - List view
- `/workout-templates/new` - Create new
- `/workout-templates/:id` - Detail view
- `/workout-templates/:id/edit` - Edit view

### Permissions
- All routes require PT-Tier or Admin-Tier claims
- No client-tier access to template management

## Success Metrics
- Time to create a new template
- Number of validation errors per submission
- Template reuse rate
- User satisfaction scores
- Feature adoption rate

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Visual Design
- State indicators using color and icons
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes

### Interaction Patterns
- Consistent with existing Admin UI patterns
- Clear primary and secondary actions
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- Inline editing where appropriate

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Clear recovery actions
- Graceful degradation for API failures
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering tests
- Form validation logic
- State management tests
- Utility function tests

### Integration Tests
- API integration tests
- Full CRUD flow tests
- State transition tests
- Error scenario tests

### E2E Tests
- Complete template creation flow
- State transition workflows
- Search and filter functionality

## Notes
- This feature depends on the completed API implementation (FEAT-021-workout-template-core)
- Should follow established patterns from other Admin features
- Consider progressive enhancement for complex interactions
- Prepare UI for future API enhancements without blocking current functionality
- Exercise management functionality will be implemented in a separate future feature
