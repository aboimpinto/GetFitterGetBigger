## Notes on Postponed Features
Based on the API documentation, the following features are postponed and require placeholder UI:
1. **Equipment Aggregation**: Show "Equipment information coming soon" message
2. **Exercise Suggestions**: Hide suggestions UI or show disabled state with tooltip
3. **Fine-grained Authorization**: Use mock auth context with PT-Tier role

## Code Quality Standards References
- Pattern: State management follows ExerciseStateService pattern (per CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md)
- Pattern: Service layer follows IExerciseService pattern
- Pattern: Component testing follows bUnit patterns from COMPREHENSIVE-TESTING-GUIDE.md
- ⚠️ No existing WorkoutTemplate UI examples found - setting new patterns for this feature

## Test Coverage Requirements (per COMPREHENSIVE-TESTING-GUIDE.md)
- Unit tests immediately after each implementation task
- Both UI interaction and logic tests for components
- Service tests covering happy path, errors, and edge cases
- Integration tests after complete workflows
- Aim for 80%+ coverage on new code
