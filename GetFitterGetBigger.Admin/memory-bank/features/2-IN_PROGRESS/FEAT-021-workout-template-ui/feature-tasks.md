## Final Phase: Manual Testing - Estimated: 2h

### Testing and Documentation
- **Task 10.1:** Create comprehensive manual testing guide following existing patterns [ReadyToDevelop] (Est: 1h)
- **Task 10.2:** Document placeholder features (equipment, suggestions) for future implementation [ReadyToDevelop] (Est: 30m)
- **Task 10.3:** Manual testing by user [ReadyForTesting] (Est: 30m)

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Template Creation Flow**
   - Create new template with all fields
   - Verify validation messages
   - Test auto-save functionality
   - Confirm template appears in list

2. **Template Editing**
   - Edit existing template
   - Verify unsaved changes warning
   - Test field validation
   - Confirm updates are saved

3. **State Transitions**
   - Move template from DRAFT to PRODUCTION
   - Verify edit restrictions on PRODUCTION templates
   - Archive template and verify restrictions
   - Test invalid state transitions

4. **Search and Filter**
   - Search by template name
   - Filter by category, difficulty, state
   - Verify pagination works correctly
   - Test combined filters

5. **Duplication**
   - Duplicate existing template
   - Verify name modification
   - Confirm new template is in DRAFT state

6. **Error Scenarios**
   - Test network error handling
   - Verify duplicate name prevention
   - Test concurrent edit scenarios

7. **Responsive Design**
   - Test on mobile viewport
   - Verify tablet layout
   - Check touch interactions

8. **Accessibility**
   - Navigate with keyboard only
   - Test with screen reader
   - Verify ARIA labels

## Notes on Postponed Features
Based on the API documentation, the following features are postponed and require placeholder UI:
1. **Equipment Aggregation**: Show "Equipment information coming soon" message
2. **Exercise Suggestions**: Hide suggestions UI or show disabled state with tooltip
3. **Fine-grained Authorization**: Use mock auth context with PT-Tier role

## Code Quality Standards References
- Pattern: State management follows ExerciseStateService pattern (per CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md)
- Pattern: Service layer follows IExerciseService pattern
- Pattern: Component testing follows bUnit patterns from COMPREHENSIVE-TESTING-GUIDE.md
- ⚠️ No existing WorkoutTemplate UI examples found - setting new patterns for this feature

## Test Coverage Requirements (per COMPREHENSIVE-TESTING-GUIDE.md)
- Unit tests immediately after each implementation task
- Both UI interaction and logic tests for components
- Service tests covering happy path, errors, and edge cases
- Integration tests after complete workflows
- Aim for 80%+ coverage on new code
