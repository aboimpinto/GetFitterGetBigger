# Features Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for all features in the GetFitterGetBigger Admin Application. The documentation is organized in a feature-centric approach to make it easier to find information about specific features and their implementation status.

## Directory Structure

```
features/
├── feature-status.md (index of all features and their status)
├── [feature-name]/
│   ├── overview.md (feature description, status, implementation details)
│   ├── tasks.md (tasks related to the feature)
│   └── issues.md (issues and their resolutions)
```

## How to Navigate

1. Start with the [Feature Status Dashboard](feature-status.md) to get an overview of all features and their current status.
2. For each feature, you can find detailed information in its dedicated directory:
   - **overview.md**: Description, implementation details, and related components
   - **tasks.md**: Completed, pending, and blocked tasks
   - **issues.md**: Active and resolved issues

## Status Definitions

- **PLANNED**: Feature is defined but work hasn't started
- **IN PROGRESS**: Work has started but is not complete
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Feature is fully built and working as expected
- **NEEDS REVISION**: Feature is built but requires changes or improvements

## Task Status Definitions

- **TODO**: Task is identified but not started
- **IN PROGRESS**: Task is currently being worked on
- **COMPLETED**: Task is finished and verified
- **BLOCKED**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies
