# [SUBMITTED] Media Upload Feature

## Status: SUBMITTED - Awaiting Refinement and Architectural Decision

### Feature Overview
The ability for Personal Trainers to upload images and videos for exercises through the Admin application.

### Why is this BLOCKED?

**No architectural decision has been made regarding the media upload implementation approach.**

Key decisions needed:
1. **Storage Strategy**:
   - Direct upload to API server filesystem?
   - Cloud storage (Azure Blob, AWS S3)?
   - Hybrid approach?

2. **Upload Method**:
   - Multipart form data?
   - Base64 encoding?
   - Chunked uploads?
   - Pre-signed URLs?

3. **Media Processing**:
   - When/where to resize images for mobile?
   - Video compression strategy?
   - Thumbnail generation?

4. **Cost Considerations**:
   - Storage costs
   - Bandwidth costs
   - Processing costs

### Documentation Available

Comprehensive analysis has been completed:
- `/api-docs/media-upload-architecture.md` - Full architectural analysis
- `/api-docs/media-upload-endpoints.md` - Proposed API endpoints
- `api-media-upload-implementation.md` - Implementation guide for Admin

### What's Needed to Unblock

1. **Business Decision**: 
   - Expected scale (number of PTs, storage requirements)
   - Budget for external services
   - Performance requirements

2. **Technical Decision**:
   - Choose primary upload approach
   - Confirm mobile optimization requirements
   - Select image/video processing strategy

3. **Infrastructure Decision**:
   - Cloud provider selection (if applicable)
   - CDN strategy
   - Backup and recovery approach

### Impact of Being Blocked

- Personal Trainers cannot add visual content to exercises
- Exercises are text-only, reducing effectiveness
- Mobile clients cannot display exercise demonstrations
- Competitive disadvantage vs other fitness platforms

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review** the architectural analysis in `/api-docs/media-upload-architecture.md`
2. **Decide** on scale expectations (MVP vs Production)
3. **Choose** an approach based on the comparison matrix
4. **Approve** budget for any external services
5. **Unblock** this feature for implementation

### Related Features Also Blocked

- Exercise video tutorials
- Exercise image galleries
- Workout thumbnails
- Progress photos (future feature)
