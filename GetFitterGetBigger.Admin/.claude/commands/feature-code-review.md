Perform a comprehensive final code review for the current feature following the code review process for Blazor applications.

Instructions:
1. Identify the current feature being worked on from the git branch or active context
2. Review ALL changes made in the feature branch against CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md and ADMIN-CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md
3. Check all previous component/page reviews if they exist
4. Perform a full scan of all files created/modified by the feature
5. Assess Blazor-specific concerns (component lifecycle, state management, rendering performance)
6. Create the review report with appropriate status (APPROVED/APPROVED_WITH_NOTES/REQUIRES_CHANGES)
7. Save the report as: `Final-Code-Review-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH-MM}-{STATUS}.md`
8. Place it in: `/memory-bank/features/2-IN_PROGRESS/FEAT-XXX/code-reviews/`

Focus areas:
- Blazor component architecture and lifecycle management
- State management patterns (centralized state, cascading values)
- Form handling and validation patterns
- UI/UX consistency and accessibility
- Performance (rendering optimization, memory leaks)
- CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md compliance
- Security (XSS prevention, authorization on components)
- Testing coverage (component tests, E2E tests)

The review should be thorough and actionable, clearly indicating whether the feature is ready for completion.
