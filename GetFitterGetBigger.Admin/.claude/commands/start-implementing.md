Can you please start implementing the feature $ARGUMENT that is already in READY_TO_DEVELOP, follwing the @memory-bank/FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROCESS.md and @memory-bank/FEATURE_WORKFLOW_PROCESS.md

Please, do not forget this is a C# Blazor. Please read  the @memory_bank for more details about the project.

Check is we are running in master or in a feature branch. In case that we are in a feature branch, DO NOT CREATE ONE and stay on this one.

If the feature is not in the right state, do not start it and inform the user the reason.
