Help me refine feature $ARGUMENT from SUBMITTED to READY_TO_DEVELOP state by:

1. **Reading the feature description** in `memory-bank/features/0-SUBMITTED/$ARGUMENT/feature-description.md`

2. **Creating a comprehensive task breakdown** (`feature-tasks.md`) following @memory-bank/FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROCESS.md that includes:
   - Feature branch name
   - Task categories organized by implementation order (API first, then components)
   - Specific tasks with time estimates in the format: `**Task X.Y:** [Description] [ReadyToDevelop] (Est: Xh Ym)`
   - Unit/component test tasks immediately following each implementation task
   - Checkpoints after each category with quality gates
   - Manual testing phase as the final task
   - Baseline health check section at the beginning

3. **Following the task organization pattern**:
   - Category 1: API Service Layer (if needed)
   - Category 2: Data Models and DTOs
   - Category 3: State Management (if needed)
   - Category 4: Shared/Base Components
   - Category 5-N: Feature-specific Components
   - Final Categories: Navigation/Integration, UI/UX Polish

4. **Moving the feature folder** from `0-SUBMITTED` to `1-READY_TO_DEVELOP` as per @memory-bank/FEATURE_WORKFLOW_PROCESS.md

5. **Updating** `feature-status.md` to reflect the status change with today's date

Ensure all tasks are actionable, testable, and follow the Admin project's Blazor patterns and conventions.
