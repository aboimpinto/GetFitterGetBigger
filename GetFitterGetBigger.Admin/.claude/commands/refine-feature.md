Help me refine feature $ARGUMENT from SUBMITTED to READY_TO_DEVELOP state by:

1. **Reading ALL feature documentation** in `memory-bank/features/0-SUBMITTED/$ARGUMENT/`:
   - Start with `feature-description.md` as the primary source
   - Read ALL other documents in the folder for detailed context and specifications
   - Note any API endpoints, data models, or specific requirements mentioned

2. **Creating a comprehensive task breakdown** (`feature-tasks.md`) following @memory-bank/FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_PROCESS.md that includes:
   - Feature branch name
   - Task PHASES (not categories) organized by implementation order
   - Specific tasks with time estimates in the format: `**Task X.Y:** [Description] [ReadyToDevelop] (Est: Xh Ym)`
   - Unit/component test tasks immediately following each implementation task
   - **CHECKPOINT after each Phase** following @memory-bank/FEATURE_CHECKPOINT_TEMPLATE.md
   - Manual testing phase as the final task
   - Baseline health check section at the beginning

3. **Consulting @memory-bank/CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md** for each task:
   - Look for similar implementation examples for the task at hand
   - Reference specific patterns or standards in the task description
   - If no example is found, highlight: "⚠️ No existing example found for [concept] - possible missing pattern documentation"

4. **Following the task organization pattern by PHASES**:
   - Phase 1: API Service Layer (if needed)
   - Phase 2: Data Models and DTOs
   - Phase 3: State Management (if needed)
   - Phase 4: Shared/Base Components
   - Phase 5-N: Feature-specific Components
   - Final Phases: Navigation/Integration, UI/UX Polish

5. **CRITICAL: After each Phase, add a CHECKPOINT section**:
   - Use the format from @memory-bank/FEATURE_CHECKPOINT_TEMPLATE.md
   - Include placeholders for Build Report, Code Review path, Git Commit hash
   - Mark as `[PENDING]` initially
   - Note: "⚠️ Cannot proceed to Phase [X+1] until this checkpoint is APPROVED"

6. **NO ASSUMPTIONS policy**:
   - If any requirement is unclear or ambiguous, create a task: "**Task X.Y:** Clarify [specific requirement] with stakeholder [BLOCKED] (Est: 15m)"
   - List all questions that need clarification in a "## Questions for Clarification" section
   - Do not make assumptions about UI behavior, data formats, or business logic

7. **Moving the feature folder** from `0-SUBMITTED` to `1-READY_TO_DEVELOP` as per @memory-bank/FEATURE_WORKFLOW_PROCESS.md

8. **Updating** `feature-status.md` to reflect the status change with today's date

Ensure all tasks are actionable, testable, and follow the Admin project's Blazor patterns and conventions. Highlight any areas where clarification is needed before implementation can begin.
