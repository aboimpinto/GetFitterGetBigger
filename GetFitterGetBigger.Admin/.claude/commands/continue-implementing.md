Continue implementing the current in-progress feature following @memory-bank/DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md.

Instructions:
1. Identify the current feature in /memory-bank/features/2-IN_PROGRESS/
2. Review feature-tasks.md to find the next uncompleted task
3. Check any previous checkpoint or code review feedback
4. Continue implementation from where it was left off
5. Stop at the next checkpoint for user confirmation

Process:
- Read the feature description and requirements
- Review completed vs remaining tasks
- Check git status for any uncommitted changes
- Continue with the next logical step
- Follow CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md during implementation

If no feature is in progress:
- Check if there are features in 1-READY_TO_DEVELOP
- Inform user no active feature found
- Suggest using /start-implementing for new features

Checkpoint behavior:
- Stop at major milestones for review
- Commit changes with descriptive messages
- Update feature-tasks.md progress
- Request user confirmation before proceeding

Always maintain code quality and test coverage while implementing.
