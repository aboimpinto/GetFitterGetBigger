# FEAT-013 Test Fixes Summary

## Initial State
- **25 tests failing** after implementing new component tests
- Mix of service registration issues, selector problems, and assertion mismatches

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Text Content Fixes ✅
- Fixed "Select role..." → "Select role" assertion
- Fixed "Saving..." → check for spinner class instead
- Fixed "Failed to create equipment" → "An unexpected error occurred"

### 2. Service Registration Fixes ✅
Added mock service registrations to all test classes:
- `IEquipmentService`
- `IMuscleGroupsService` 
- `IReferenceDataService`

### 3. Selector Fixes ✅
- Changed `input[type='text']` → `input` (InputText doesn't set type attribute)
- Fixed option selection to use proper element queries
- Updated button selectors to find by text content

### 4. Test Logic Fixes ✅
- Updated duplicate prevention tests to match actual component behavior
- Fixed async test handling for form submissions
- Corrected assertions to match component validation approach

## Results

### Before Fixes
- **Total Tests**: 40 (new component tests)
- **Passing**: 15
- **Failing**: 25
- **Success Rate**: 37.5%

### After Fixes
- **Total Tests**: 40
- **Passing**: 33
- **Failing**: 7
- **Success Rate**: 82.5%

### Remaining Failures (7)
All in MuscleGroupSelectorTests:
1. `MuscleGroupSelector_AddsNewMuscleGroupWithRole`
2. `MuscleGroupSelector_RemovesMuscleGroupWhenTagXClicked`
3. `MuscleGroupSelector_EnforcesSinglePrimaryRule`
4. `MuscleGroupSelector_DisablesAddButtonWhenNoMuscleGroupSelected`
5. `MuscleGroupSelector_ResetsFormAfterSuccessfulAdd`
6. `MuscleGroupSelector_RaisesOnMuscleGroupsChangedEvent`

Plus one in AddReferenceItemModalTests:
7. `AddReferenceItemModal_PreventsDuplicateSubmissions`

## Key Learnings

### Component Behavior Insights
1. MuscleGroupSelector prevents duplicates by filtering available options, not showing validation messages
2. AddReferenceItemModal uses EditForm with InputText components
3. Button disabled states are controlled by component logic, not HTML attributes
4. Async operations in tests need proper handling with TaskCompletionSource

### bUnit Testing Patterns
1. Use `QuerySelectorAll` on specific elements to avoid finding options from multiple selects
2. Find buttons by text content when multiple buttons exist
3. Mock services must be registered before rendering components
4. Form submissions in EditForm context behave differently than regular forms

## Next Steps
The remaining 7 failures appear to be related to:
- Component interaction timing issues
- MuscleGroupTag component integration
- Event callback verification

These would require deeper investigation into the component implementation details.
