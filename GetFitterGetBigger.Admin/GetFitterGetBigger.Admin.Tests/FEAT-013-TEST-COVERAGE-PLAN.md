### Service Coverage
The following services have good coverage but need tests for inline creation features:
1. **EquipmentService** (100% line coverage) - Needs tests for cache invalidation
2. **MuscleGroupsService** (100% line coverage) - Needs tests for cache invalidation

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Component Unit Tests (Priority: High)

#### 1. TagBasedMultiSelectTests.cs ✅ COMPLETED
**Purpose**: Test the generic tag-based multi-select component
**Status**: 12 tests created and passing
**Test Cases**:
- ✅ Renders with empty selection
- ✅ Displays selected items as tags
- ✅ Allows adding new items from dropdown
- ✅ Prevents duplicate selections
- ✅ Removes items when tag X is clicked
- ✅ Shows placeholder when no selection

- 🔴 Removes muscle group when tag X is clicked (service missing)
- ✅ Shows inline creation hint appropriately
- 🔴 Raises OnSelectionChanged event (service missing)
- 🔴 Resets form after successful add (service missing)
- 🔴 Disables add button when no selection (service missing)

#### 3. EnhancedReferenceSelectTests.cs 🛠️ IN PROGRESS

**Test Cases**:
- ✅ Renders as standard select when inline creation disabled
- ✅ Shows inline creation button when enabled
- ✅ Displays keyboard shortcut hint when enabled

- 🔴 Shows optimistic update after creation (service missing)
- 🔴 Maintains selection state during modal interaction (service missing)
- ✅ Disables select when disabled
- ✅ Shows placeholder option
- ✅ Handles value change
- 🔴 Selects newly created item (service missing)
- 🔴 Handles cancelled creation (service missing)
- ✅ Shows correct border color when inline creation enabled

#### 4. AddReferenceItemModalTests.cs 🛠️ IN PROGRESS
**Purpose**: Test the modal component for creating reference items
**Status**: 14 tests created, 10 passing, 4 failing (form handling issues)
**Test Cases**:
- ✅ Shows correct title based on EntityType
- 🔴 Displays appropriate form fields for equipment (input selector issue)
- 🔴 Displays appropriate form fields for muscle group (input selector issue)
- ✅ Validates required fields
- 🔴 Shows loading state during save (text content mismatch)
- 🔴 Displays error message on failure (selector issue)
- ✅ Invokes OnCancel when cancelled
- ✅ Closes on escape key
- ✅ Clears form on successful save
- 🔴 Prevents duplicate submissions (selector issue)
- ✅ Invokes OnItemCreated callback
- ✅ Handles equipment creation
- ✅ Handles muscle group creation

### Phase 2: Integration Tests (Priority: Medium)

#### 5. ExerciseFormInlineCreationIntegrationTests.cs (Enhanced)
**Purpose**: Test the complete inline creation flow in ExerciseForm
**Additional Test Cases**:
- ✅ Equipment creation updates all equipment dropdowns
- ✅ Muscle group creation updates muscle group selector
- ✅ Form maintains all data during modal operations
- ✅ Multiple inline creations in succession
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts work in form context
- ✅ Created items are pre-selected after creation
- ✅ Error handling preserves form state

### Phase 3: Service Tests (Priority: Medium)

#### 6. ReferenceDataServiceCacheTests.cs (Enhanced)
**Purpose**: Test cache invalidation for reference data
**Test Cases**:
- ✅ ClearEquipmentCache removes cached equipment
- ✅ ClearMuscleGroupsCache removes cached muscle groups
- ✅ Subsequent calls fetch fresh data from API
- ✅ Other caches remain intact when one is cleared

### Phase 4: End-to-End Scenarios (Priority: Low)

#### 7. FEAT013EndToEndTests.cs
**Purpose**: Test complete user workflows
**Test Scenarios**:
1. **New Exercise with Inline Equipment Creation**
   - Start creating new exercise
   - Add new equipment via inline creation
   - Complete exercise creation
   - Verify equipment appears in edit mode

2. **New Exercise with Inline Muscle Group Creation**
   - Start creating new exercise
   - Add new muscle group via inline creation
   - Assign role to muscle group
   - Complete exercise creation
   - Verify muscle group appears correctly

3. **Edit Exercise with Mixed Inline Creation**
   - Open existing exercise
   - Add new equipment inline
   - Add new muscle group inline
   - Save changes
   - Verify all updates persisted

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Structure
```csharp
public class ComponentNameTests : TestContext
{
    // Setup common test data
    private readonly Mock<IServiceName> _mockService;
    
    public ComponentNameTests()
    {
        _mockService = new Mock<IServiceName>();
        Services.AddSingleton(_mockService.Object);
    }
    
    [Fact]
    public void ComponentName_BehaviorDescription_ExpectedResult()
    {
        // Arrange
        
        // Act
        
        // Assert
    }
}
```

### Best Practices
1. Use descriptive test names following pattern: `ComponentName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`
2. Keep tests focused on single behavior
3. Use FluentAssertions for readable assertions
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Test both positive and negative cases
6. Include edge cases and error scenarios
7. Use TestContext.RenderComponent for Blazor components
8. Verify event callbacks are invoked correctly

### Coverage Goals
- Target: 80%+ coverage for new components
- Focus on business logic and user interactions
- Don't test framework code or simple property getters/setters
- Prioritize testing error handling and edge cases

## Estimated Effort
- Phase 1: 4-6 hours (component unit tests)
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours (integration tests)
- Phase 3: 1-2 hours (service tests)
- Phase 4: 2-3 hours (end-to-end tests)

**Total: 9-14 hours**

## Success Criteria
1. All new components have comprehensive unit tests
2. Integration tests verify component interactions
3. Service cache invalidation is thoroughly tested
4. No regression in existing test coverage
5. All tests pass consistently
6. Coverage metrics improve for affected areas
