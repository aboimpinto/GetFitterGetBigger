# Cache Logging Output Examples

[Cache MISS] No cached data found for key: Equipment:all. Fetching from database...
[Cache] Fetched 15 Equipment entities from database
[Cache SET] Cached 15 Equipment entities with key: Equipment:all for duration: 00:30:00
[Cache HIT] Successfully retrieved 15 Equipment entities from cache with key: Equipment:all
[Cache] Attempting to retrieve Equipment by ID with key: Equipment:id:equipment-123
[Cache HIT] Successfully retrieved Equipment from cache with key: Equipment:id:equipment-123
[Cache INVALIDATION] Starting cache invalidation for pattern: Equipment:*
[Cache PATTERN REMOVE] Removing 25 keys matching pattern: Equipment:*

[Cache REMOVE] Successfully removed key: Equipment:id:equipment-123
[Cache PATTERN REMOVE] Completed removal of all keys matching pattern: Equipment:*

## After (Reduced Logging)

## Key Changes

1. **Removed verbose logging for**:
   - Individual cache hit/miss messages
   - Detailed key information in logs
   - Step-by-step pattern removal progress
   - Debug messages for cache operations

2. **Kept essential information**:
   - Cache filling with item count
   - Cache invalidation notifications
   - Error messages (unchanged)
   - Warning messages for business logic (e.g., "Cannot deactivate equipment")

3. **Benefits**:
   - Cleaner logs focused on important operations
   - Easier to spot actual issues
   - Reduced log volume
   - Still tracks critical cache operations
