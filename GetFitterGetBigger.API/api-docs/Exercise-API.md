# Exercise API Documentation

## Overview

The Exercise API provides endpoints for managing exercises in the fitness tracking system. Exercises are the building blocks of workout plans and include detailed information about movements, muscle groups, equipment, and weight requirements.

  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 10,
  "totalCount": 150,
  "totalPages": 15,
  "hasPreviousPage": false,
  "hasNextPage": true
}
```

### GET /api/Exercises/{id}

Retrieves a specific exercise by ID.

**Parameters:**
- `id` (string, required): The exercise ID

**Response:** Exercise DTO (see data model above)

**Error Responses:**
- `404 Not Found`: Exercise not found

### POST /api/Exercises

Creates a new exercise.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "Bulgarian Split Squat",
  "description": "Single-leg exercise for leg strength and balance",
  "coachNotes": [
    {
      "text": "Keep your torso upright",
      "order": 0
    },
    {
      "text": "Drive through your front heel",
      "order": 1
    }
  ],
  "exerciseTypeIds": ["exercisetype-..."],
  "videoUrl": "https://example.com/bulgarian-split-squat.mp4",
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/bulgarian-split-squat.jpg",
  "isUnilateral": true,
  "difficultyId": "difficultylevel-...",
  "kineticChainId": "kineticchaintype-...",
  "exerciseWeightTypeId": "exerciseweighttype-c3d5c4b6-7b8c-6d9e-0f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7a",
  "muscleGroups": [
    {
      "muscleGroupId": "musclegroup-...",
      "muscleRoleId": "musclerole-..."
    }
  ],
  "equipmentIds": ["equipment-..."],
  "movementPatternIds": ["movementpattern-..."],
  "bodyPartIds": ["bodypart-..."]
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- `exerciseWeightTypeId` is optional. If not specified, the exercise will not have weight validation rules.
- `kineticChainId` is required for non-REST exercises, must be null for REST exercises
- At least one muscle group is required for non-REST exercises

**Response:** Created Exercise DTO

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: Validation errors
- `409 Conflict`: Exercise with the same name already exists

### PUT /api/Exercises/{id}

Updates an existing exercise.

**Parameters:**
- `id` (string, required): The exercise ID

**Request Body:** Same as POST request, with these differences:
- `isActive` (boolean, optional): Set exercise active/inactive status
- `isUnilateral` (boolean, optional): If not provided, keeps existing value
- `exerciseWeightTypeId` (string, optional): Update the exercise's weight type. If not provided, keeps existing value
- Coach notes with IDs will update existing notes, without IDs will create new ones

**Example PUT Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "Updated Bulgarian Split Squat",
  "description": "Single-leg exercise for leg strength and balance - updated",
  "coachNotes": [
    {
      "id": "coachnote-123...",
      "text": "Keep your torso upright throughout the movement",
      "order": 0
    },
    {
      "text": "New tip: Focus on slow eccentric phase",
      "order": 1
    }
  ],
  "exerciseTypeIds": ["exercisetype-..."],
  "videoUrl": "https://example.com/bulgarian-split-squat-v2.mp4",
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/bulgarian-split-squat-v2.jpg",
  "isUnilateral": true,
  "isActive": true,
  "difficultyId": "difficultylevel-...",
  "kineticChainId": "kineticchaintype-...",
  "exerciseWeightTypeId": "exerciseweighttype-1b3d5f7a-5b7c-4d8e-9f0a-1b2c3d4e5f6a",
  "muscleGroups": [
    {
      "muscleGroupId": "musclegroup-...",
      "muscleRoleId": "musclerole-..."
    }
  ],
  "equipmentIds": ["equipment-..."],
  "movementPatternIds": ["movementpattern-..."],
  "bodyPartIds": ["bodypart-..."]
}
```

**Response:** Updated Exercise DTO

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: Validation errors
- `404 Not Found`: Exercise not found
- `409 Conflict`: Another exercise with the same name already exists

### DELETE /api/Exercises/{id}

Deletes an exercise. If the exercise has references (e.g., in workout logs), it will be soft-deleted (marked as inactive). Otherwise, it will be permanently deleted.

**Parameters:**
- `id` (string, required): The exercise ID

**Response:** 
- `200 OK`: Exercise deleted successfully
- `404 Not Found`: Exercise not found

## Exercise Weight Type Integration

### Weight Type Assignment

When creating or updating an exercise, you can assign an `exerciseWeightTypeId` to define how weight should be handled:

```json
{
  "exerciseWeightTypeId": "exerciseweighttype-c3d5c4b6-7b8c-6d9e-0f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7a"
}
```

### Weight Validation Rules

The assigned weight type determines validation rules when logging workout sets:

| Weight Type | Rule | Example Exercises |
|-------------|------|-------------------|
| Bodyweight Only | Weight must be null or 0 | Pull-ups, Push-ups |
| Bodyweight Optional | Weight â‰¥ 0 or null | Dips, Chin-ups |
| Weight Required | Weight > 0 | Barbell Bench Press, Deadlift |
| Machine Weight | Weight > 0 | Leg Press, Cable Row |
| No Weight | Weight must be null or 0 | Plank, Stretching |

### Legacy Support

Exercises without a weight type (null `exerciseWeightTypeId`) will accept any weight value for backward compatibility.

## Validation Rules

1. **Name**: Required, max 200 characters, must be unique
2. **Description**: Required, max 1000 characters
3. **Exercise Types**: At least one required, REST type cannot be combined with others
4. **Muscle Groups**: Required for non-REST exercises
5. **Kinetic Chain**: Required for non-REST exercises, must be null for REST exercises
6. **URLs**: Must be valid URLs if provided
