# Accuracy in Failure Analysis - Critical Guidelines

## Context
During FEAT-024 BDD Integration Tests implementation, an important issue was identified regarding the accuracy of failure analysis and reporting.

## The Problem
When BDD tests were failing, an inaccurate explanation was provided:
- **Incorrect Analysis**: "advanced scenarios - refinement needed"
- **Actual Root Cause**: "MissingStepDefinitionException - step definitions don't match Gherkin syntax"

## Why This Matters
1. **Accuracy**: Provides misleading information about the actual problem
2. **Debugging**: Leads developers down wrong paths for troubleshooting
3. **Learning**: Prevents proper understanding of the underlying issues
4. **Trust**: Erodes confidence in analysis and recommendations

## Critical Guidelines

### When You Can Identify the Root Cause
- Provide specific, technical explanations
- Include exact error messages and line numbers when available
- Reference specific files and code locations
- Explain the technical mechanism causing the failure

### When You Cannot Identify the Root Cause
**NEVER** provide speculative or made-up reasons. Instead:
- State clearly: "I cannot determine the root cause of this failure"
- List what you have observed (symptoms, error patterns, etc.)
- Suggest specific investigation steps
- Recommend getting additional context or assistance

## Example: Correct Approach

### ❌ Incorrect (Speculative)
```
"Tests failing due to advanced scenarios - refinement needed"
```

### ✅ Correct (Accurate)
```
"6 BDD tests failing with MissingStepDefinitionException. 
Issue: Feature file uses 'Given I send a GET request...' (line 18) 
but RequestSteps.cs only has '[When(@...)]' pattern (line 21). 
Missing '[Given(@...)]' attribute pattern for HTTP requests."
```

### ✅ Alternative (When Root Cause Unknown)
```
"6 BDD tests are failing. I can see MissingStepDefinitionException errors 
but I cannot determine the exact root cause. Recommend investigating:
1. Step definition pattern matching
2. Gherkin syntax alignment
3. Missing step implementations"
```

## Possible Reasons for Inaccurate Analysis
When you find yourself unable to provide accurate analysis, it could be due to:
- Context limitations or information overload
- Complexity of the system beyond current understanding
- Need for additional investigation tools or methods
- Pattern recognition issues in complex scenarios

**The key is acknowledging these limitations rather than masking them with speculation.**

## Documentation Standards
- Always document actual root causes once discovered
- Include specific technical details and locations
- Update any previous inaccurate analysis with corrections
- Use this documentation as reference for similar future issues

## Accountability
This document serves as a reminder that:
1. Accuracy is more valuable than appearing knowledgeable
2. "I don't know" is a valid and often helpful response
3. Precise technical analysis builds trust and effectiveness
4. Speculation without evidence undermines debugging efforts
