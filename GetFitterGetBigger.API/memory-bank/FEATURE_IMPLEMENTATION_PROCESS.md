# Feature Implementation Process

This document outlines the standard process for implementing new features in the GetFitterGetBigger API project.

## Process Overview

### 1. Feature Analysis & Planning
- User provides detailed feature requirements and specifications
- Create a comprehensive implementation plan with granular tasks
- Each task is marked with status `[ReadyToDevelop]`
- Tasks should be specific, actionable, and independently verifiable

### 2. Branch Creation
- Create a dedicated feature branch from master
- Naming convention: `feature/[descriptive-feature-name]`
- All development work occurs in this isolated branch

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Execute tasks sequentially from the implementation plan
- After completing each task:
  - Mark as `[Implemented: <git-commit-hash>]`
  - Include comprehensive unit tests
  - Ensure all tests pass before proceeding
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns

### 4. Test Development & Handling
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- If a test requires more than 2-3 interactions to implement:
  - Create a `[BUG: <detailed-reason>]` entry
  - Mark test with Skip/Ignore attribute
  - Include bug reference in test comment
  - Example: `[Skip("BUG-001: Complex mocking scenario requires additional framework setup")]`

### 5. Manual Testing Phase (DEFAULT BEHAVIOR)
- After all implementation tasks are complete
- Provide user with:
  - Detailed step-by-step testing instructions
  - Expected outcomes for each test scenario
  - Sample data or commands if applicable
- Wait for user acceptance before proceeding

### 6. Feature Finalization
After user explicitly states feature acceptance:
1. Merge feature branch into master
2. Create descriptive commit message summarizing all changes
3. Push to remote repository
4. Delete the feature branch locally

### 7. Special Conditions
- **Skipping Manual Tests**: Only when user explicitly requests during initial feature specification
- **Interrupted Implementation**: Next session can resume using existing task list with current statuses
- **Git Operations**: All git operations require explicit user approval and are not automated

## Task Status Definitions
- `[ReadyToDevelop]` - Task identified and ready to implement
- `[Implemented: <hash>]` - Task completed with reference commit
- `[BUG: <reason>]` - Known issue requiring future resolution
- `[Skipped]` - Task deferred or determined unnecessary

## Important Notes
- This process ensures code quality through comprehensive testing
- User maintains control over deployment and merge decisions
- Clear audit trail through commit hashes and bug tracking
- Supports both continuous and interrupted development workflows
