# Architecture Refactoring Initiative

## Overview
This document tracks the architectural refactoring initiative to enforce proper separation of concerns in the GetFitterGetBigger API. The goal is to ensure that controllers never directly access repositories or UnitOfWork, and instead communicate only through a service layer.

## Architectural Rules (MANDATORY)
1. **Controllers MUST NOT directly access repositories** - This is FORBIDDEN
2. **Controllers MUST NOT directly access UnitOfWork (ReadOnly or Writable)** - This is FORBIDDEN
3. **Controllers MUST ONLY communicate with Service layer**

## Current State Analysis (as of 2025-01-07)

### Compliance Status
- **Total Controllers**: 10 (excluding base controller)
- **Compliant**: 2 (20%)
  - ✅ AuthController
  - ✅ ExercisesController
- **Non-Compliant**: 8 (80%)
  - ❌ EquipmentController
  - ❌ MuscleGroupsController
  - ❌ BodyPartsController
  - ❌ DifficultyLevelsController
  - ❌ ExerciseTypesController
  - ❌ KineticChainTypesController
  - ❌ MetricTypesController
  - ❌ MovementPatternsController
  - ❌ MuscleRolesController
  - ❌ ReferenceTablesBaseController (base class)

## Refactoring Features Created

### Phase 1: Critical Controllers
1. **FEAT-015**: Refactor Equipment Controller to Use Service Layer
   - Status: SUBMITTED
   - Priority: High (has CRUD operations)

2. **FEAT-016**: Refactor MuscleGroups Controller to Use Service Layer
   - Status: SUBMITTED
   - Priority: High (complex business logic)

3. **FEAT-017**: Refactor ReferenceTablesBase Controller and Create Generic Service Pattern
   - Status: SUBMITTED
   - Priority: Critical (affects 7 other controllers)

### Phase 2: Reference Table Controllers
These controllers will be refactored as part of FEAT-017:
- BodyPartsController
- DifficultyLevelsController
- ExerciseTypesController
- KineticChainTypesController
- MetricTypesController
- MovementPatternsController
- MuscleRolesController

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Order
1. **Start with FEAT-017** - This creates the generic pattern that other controllers will use
2. **Then FEAT-015** - Equipment Controller as a concrete example
3. **Finally FEAT-016** - MuscleGroups Controller with complex logic

### Pattern to Follow
Use the existing compliant controllers as examples:
- **AuthController** → uses IAuthService
- **ExercisesController** → uses IExerciseService

### Service Layer Responsibilities
- Create and manage UnitOfWork instances
- Access repositories
- Implement business logic
- Handle transactions (CommitAsync)
- Manage caching

### Controller Responsibilities
- HTTP request/response handling
- Input validation via attributes
- Authorization checks
- Call service methods
- Map service results to HTTP responses

## Success Metrics
- 100% of controllers compliant with architectural rules
- All tests passing after refactoring
- No direct repository access in any controller
- No UnitOfWork usage in any controller
- Consistent service layer pattern across all controllers

## Long-term Benefits
1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Testability**: Easier to mock services than repositories
3. **Flexibility**: Can change data access strategy without touching controllers
4. **Consistency**: All controllers follow the same pattern
5. **Transaction Management**: Centralized in service layer
6. **Business Logic**: Properly encapsulated in services

## Notes
- This refactoring does not change any external API contracts
- All existing endpoints remain the same
- Only the internal architecture is being improved
- This aligns with industry best practices for layered architecture
