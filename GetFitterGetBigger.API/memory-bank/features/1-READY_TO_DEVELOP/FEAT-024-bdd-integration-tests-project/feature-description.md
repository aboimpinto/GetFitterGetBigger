# Feature: BDD Integration Tests Project

## Feature ID
FEAT-024

## Feature Title
Create BDD Integration Tests Project with SpecFlow and TestContainers

## Description
Create a new C# test project called `GetFitterGetBigger.API.IntegrationTests` that will serve as the primary host for integration tests using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach. The project will use SpecFlow for Gherkin language syntax and TestContainers.PostgreSQL for database testing.

This is a migration strategy where existing integration tests will be gradually rewritten using Gherkin syntax, providing better readability and business alignment.

## Business Value
- **Improved Test Readability**: Gherkin syntax makes tests readable by non-technical stakeholders
- **Better Test Organization**: Feature files group related scenarios logically
- **Reusable Test Steps**: Given/When/Then steps can be shared across multiple scenarios
- **Living Documentation**: Feature files serve as executable specifications
- **Consistent Test Infrastructure**: Centralized test setup using TestContainers

## Technical Requirements

### Project Setup
1. Create new test project: `GetFitterGetBigger.API.IntegrationTests`
2. Add to existing .NET solution
3. Configure as test project with appropriate SDK

### Dependencies
- SpecFlow (latest stable version)
- SpecFlow.xUnit or SpecFlow.NUnit
- TestContainers.PostgreSQL
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing (for WebApplicationFactory)
- All necessary API project references

### Infrastructure Components
1. **Test Host Setup**
   - WebApplicationFactory configuration
   - TestContainers PostgreSQL setup
   - Database initialization and seeding
   - Test-specific configuration

2. **Step Definitions**
   - Authentication steps (Given I am authenticated as...)
   - API request steps (When I send a GET/POST/PUT/DELETE request...)
   - Response validation steps (Then the response status should be...)
   - Database state steps (Given the following data exists...)

3. **Hooks and Utilities**
   - ScenarioContext management
   - Request/Response helpers
   - Database cleanup between scenarios
   - Test data builders

## Acceptance Criteria
### Phase 1 - Infrastructure Setup
1. New project created and added to solution
2. Basic infrastructure implemented:
   - WebApplicationFactory with TestContainers
   - Database initialization with migrations
   - Basic step definitions covering 80% of common scenarios
   - Proper cleanup between test runs
3. At least three example feature files demonstrating:
   - CRUD operations (Exercise management)
   - Authentication scenarios
   - Validation and error handling
   - Reference data relationships
4. Documentation completed:
   - README.md with quick start guide
   - Step definition catalog
   - Feature writing guidelines
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Migration tracking template
5. Integration with existing infrastructure:
   - Tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
   - Test results visible in build artifacts
   - No conflicts with existing test projects
   - Both test suites run in parallel during migration

### Phase 2 - Full Migration
6. All integration tests migrated from API.Tests
7. Test coverage equal or better than original
8. Performance benchmarks documented
9. Old test infrastructure removed from API.Tests
10. Team trained on new BDD approach

## Technical Considerations
- **Container Management**: 
  - Reuse containers across test classes where possible
  - Implement proper disposal to avoid resource leaks
  - Configure health checks for container readiness
- **Performance**:
  - Target < 30 seconds for full test suite
  - Enable parallel execution at feature level
  - Use collection fixtures for shared setup
- **Data Isolation**:
  - Each scenario runs in transaction (rollback after)
  - Reference data persists across scenarios
  - Test data cleanup strategies documented
- **Authentication**:
  - Mock JWT token generation for different roles
  - Support for anonymous/authenticated scenarios
  - Token expiration testing capabilities
  - **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Authorization requirements are not fully defined
    - Known roles: PT-Tier, Admin-Tier, Free-Tier
    - Future roles: WorkoutPlan-Tier, DietPlan-Tier
    - **MUST ASK** for each endpoint's authorization requirements
    - **NEVER ASSUME** which roles can access what

## Migration Strategy
- **Phase 1 - Infrastructure Setup**: Create new BDD test project with core infrastructure
- **Phase 2 - Parallel Testing**: 
  - New features use BDD approach
  - Existing tests remain in API.Tests
  - Gradually migrate test-by-test
- **Phase 3 - Test-by-Test Migration**:
  - Maintain migration tracker document
  - Each test migrated must maintain or improve coverage
  - Both old and new tests run in CI/CD during migration
- **Phase 4 - Verification**:
  - Compare coverage metrics (must be equal or better)
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Full regression testing
- **Phase 5 - Cleanup**:
  - Only after 100% migration and verification
  - Remove old integration test infrastructure from API.Tests
  - Archive migration documentation

## Dependencies
- Docker Desktop must be installed on developer machines
- CI/CD environment must support Docker containers
- No blocking dependencies on other features

## Estimated Effort
### Phase 1 - Initial Setup
- Project setup and basic infrastructure: 4-6 hours
- Core step definitions: 4-6 hours
- Example features and documentation: 2-3 hours
- CI/CD integration and testing: 2 hours
- Migration planning and tracking setup: 2 hours
- Team training and knowledge transfer: 2 hours
- **Phase 1 Total: 18-21 hours**

### Phase 2 - Migration
- Test-by-test migration: 20-30 hours (incremental over time)
- Verification and cleanup: 3 hours
- **Phase 2 Total: 23-33 hours**

### **Total Project Effort: 41-54 hours**

## Priority
Medium - This provides long-term value but doesn't block current development

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- SpecFlow+ LivingDoc integration for better reporting
- Visual Studio Code extensions for Gherkin syntax
- Automated step definition generation
- Performance benchmarking framework
- Cross-browser testing for UI components
