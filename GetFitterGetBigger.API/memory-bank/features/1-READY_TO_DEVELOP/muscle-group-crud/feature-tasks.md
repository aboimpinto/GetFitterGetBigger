## Notes
- Keep existing GET endpoints unchanged for backward compatibility
- Use soft delete to preserve referential integrity
- Authorization will be added when ReferenceData-Management claim is defined
- Consider batch operations for future enhancement
- Time estimates are based on manual implementation without AI assistance
