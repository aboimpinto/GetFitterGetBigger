# Blocked Reason

## Feature: Exercise Management CRUD
## Blocked Date: 2025-01-27

## Blocking Issue
**BUG-001**: [Authorize] attribute not working correctly

## Specific Task Blocked
- **Task 5.3:** Add [Authorize] attribute for admin-only access

## Impact
- Cannot secure exercise endpoints with proper authorization
- Admin-only access control cannot be implemented
- Feature is functionally complete but lacks security

## Workaround
- None available - authorization is critical for production

## Dependencies
- Fix for BUG-001 must be implemented first
- Once fixed, only Task 5.3 needs to be completed

## Notes
- All other tasks (95%) are completed and tested
- Feature can be demonstrated without authorization
- Should be quick to complete once blocker is resolved
