# FEAT-012: Automatic Database Migration on Startup

## Feature ID: FEAT-012
## Submitted: 2025-01-30
## Status: IN_PROGRESS
## Priority: High
## Category: Infrastructure
## Requirements Clarified: 2025-01-30
## Requirements Engineer: Paulo Aboim Pinto (Requirements Engineer)

## Description
Implement automatic database creation and migration handling during application startup to prevent runtime errors caused by missing database schemas or unapplied migrations.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the application can fail at runtime if:
- The database doesn't exist (first-time setup)
- Migrations haven't been applied
- New migrations are pending after deployment

This was demonstrated by BUG-007 where a missing migration caused the exercise endpoints to fail with "column m.CreatedAt does not exist" error.

## Proposed Solution
Add startup logic that:
1. Checks if the database exists
2. Creates the database if it doesn't exist
3. Applies all pending migrations automatically
4. Logs migration activities for monitoring
5. Optionally validates the schema matches the EF model

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application creates database on first run using Migrate()
- [ ] Application applies pending migrations on startup automatically
- [ ] Migration process is logged using standard EF Core logging
- [ ] Application exits gracefully with clear error if migrations fail
- [ ] No manual intervention required for database setup
- [ ] Migration failures prevent application from starting
- [ ] Standard appsettings.json configuration is used

## Technical Requirements (Clarified)

### 1. Migration Strategy
- **Decision**: Use `context.Database.Migrate()` exclusively
- **Rationale**: Supports production applications with migration history and incremental schema updates
- **Behavior**: Creates database if missing, applies pending migrations

### 2. Environment Configuration
- **All Environments**: Enable automatic migration on startup
- **Note**: While powerful, acknowledge production risks
- **Implementation**: Use standard appsettings.json configuration

### 3. Concurrent Instance Handling
- **Decision**: Rely on EF Core's built-in handling
- **Details**: EF Core's Migrate() method handles concurrency automatically

### 4. Failure Behavior
- **Decision**: Application must crash/exit gracefully on migration failure
- **Rationale**: Prevents runtime bugs and data corruption from schema mismatches
- **Implementation**: Wrap Migrate() in try-catch, log error, exit application

### 5. Performance Expectations
- **First Run**: Longest duration (database creation + all migrations)
- **Subsequent Runs**: Milliseconds (single query to __EFMigrationsHistory)
- **Acceptance**: Variable time accepted, depends on migration complexity

### 6. Rollback Strategy
- **Decision**: Use EF Core's automatic transaction rollback
- **Details**: Each migration runs in its own transaction
- **Behavior**: Failed migration leaves database in pre-migration state

### 7. Configuration Design
- **Decision**: Use standard appsettings.json
- **Structure**: Standard C# configuration for maximum flexibility
- **No special configuration flags required**

### 8. Monitoring & Logging
- **Decision**: Use standard EF Core logging
- **Details**: EF Core logs migration details at Debug level
- **No special monitoring requirements**

## Benefits
- Eliminates manual migration steps
- Prevents runtime errors from missing schemas
- Simplifies deployment process
- Improves developer experience
- Reduces support tickets

## Risks (Acknowledged)
- Auto-migration in production acknowledged as powerful but risky
- Startup time will increase (accepted, variable based on migrations)
- Migration failures will prevent app startup (desired behavior)
- Concurrent migrations handled by EF Core automatically

## Dependencies
- Entity Framework Core
- Current migration system
- Application startup pipeline

## Notes
This feature would have prevented BUG-007 and similar issues. Consider adding:
- Migration history validation
- Schema drift detection
- Rollback capabilities
- Health check endpoint for migration status
