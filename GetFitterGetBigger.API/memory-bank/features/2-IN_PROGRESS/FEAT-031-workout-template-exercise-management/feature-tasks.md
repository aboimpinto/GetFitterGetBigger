## üîç Codebase Study Findings

### Current Implementation Analysis

**Existing WorkoutTemplate Functionality:**
- ‚úÖ Complete CRUD operations (`/GetFitterGetBigger.API/Services/WorkoutTemplate/WorkoutTemplateService.cs`)
- ‚úÖ WorkoutTemplate entity with WorkoutState lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ Existing WorkoutTemplateExerciseService with zone-based organization (Warmup/Main/Cooldown)
- ‚úÖ SetConfiguration system (to be replaced with JSON metadata)
- ‚úÖ 1,750+ passing tests (1,395 unit + 355 integration)
- ‚úÖ ServiceResult<T> pattern for error handling
- ‚úÖ ServiceValidate pattern for validation chains
- ‚úÖ Repository pattern with ReadOnly/Writable UnitOfWork separation
- ‚úÖ Controller endpoints with proper authorization

**ExecutionProtocol Integration Available:**
- ‚úÖ Fully implemented ExecutionProtocol entity (`/GetFitterGetBigger.API/Models/Entities/ExecutionProtocol.cs`)
- ‚úÖ Enum with 4 values: WARMUP(0), COOLDOWN(1), WORKOUT(2), ALTERNATIVE(3)
- ‚úÖ Cached reference data service with eternal caching
- ‚úÖ Controller and repository layers complete
- ‚úÖ String values: "Reps and Sets" (REPS_AND_SETS), SUPERSET, DROP_SET, AMRAP

**ExerciseLink System Available:**
- ‚úÖ Complete four-way linking system (`/GetFitterGetBigger.API/Services/Exercise/Features/Links/ExerciseLinkService.cs`)
- ‚úÖ Bidirectional link creation/deletion with WARMUP‚ÜíWORKOUT, COOLDOWN‚ÜíWORKOUT patterns
- ‚úÖ ExerciseLinkType enum: WARMUP, COOLDOWN, WORKOUT, ALTERNATIVE
- ‚úÖ Auto-linking algorithm already implemented
- ‚úÖ Advanced validation with ServiceValidate pattern
- ‚úÖ Repository and data service layers complete

**Current WorkoutTemplateExercise Implementation:**
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Current entity uses old WorkoutZone enum (Warmup/Main/Cooldown) instead of Phase strings
- ‚ùå Uses SetConfiguration collection instead of JSON metadata
- ‚ùå Missing ExecutionProtocol integration
- ‚ùå No auto-linking with ExerciseLinks
- ‚ùå No round-based organization
- ‚ùå No GUID-based exercise identification

**Key Patterns to Follow:**
- ServiceResult<T> pattern for all service methods (`/GetFitterGetBigger.API/Services/Results/ServiceResult.cs`)
- ServiceValidate for validation chains (`/GetFitterGetBigger.API/Services/Validation/ServiceValidate.cs`)
- Entity Handler patterns with validation (`/GetFitterGetBigger.API/Models/Entities/ExecutionProtocol.cs` lines 43-105)
- Repository base class pattern (`/GetFitterGetBigger.API/Repositories/RepositoryBase.cs`)
- Empty pattern implementation (`/GetFitterGetBigger.API/Models/Entities/WorkoutTemplateExercise.cs` lines 39-46)

## üß™ Test Structure Requirements

### Global Acceptance Tests
**Location**: `acceptance-tests/WorkoutTemplateExerciseManagement.feature`
- Test complete workflows: API ‚Üí Admin and API ‚Üí Clients
- End-to-end business processes validation
- Cross-project integration scenarios

### Project-Specific Minimal Acceptance Tests
**Location**: `Tests/Features/WorkoutTemplateExercise/WorkoutTemplateExerciseManagementAcceptanceTests.cs`
- BDD format with Given/When/Then
- Focus on critical API project paths
- Based on integration test patterns

### BDD Test Scenarios (MANDATORY)

#### Scenario 1: Add Workout Exercise with Auto-Linking
```gherkin
Given I am authenticated as "PT-Tier"
And a workout template "Leg Burning I" exists with ExecutionProtocol "REPS_AND_SETS"
And a workout exercise "Barbell Squat" exists with warmup exercise "High Knees" linked
When I send a POST request to "/api/workout-templates/{templateId}/exercises" with:
  """
  {
    "exerciseId": "barbell-squat-123",
    "phase": "Workout",
    "roundNumber": 1,
    "metadata": {
      "reps": 10,
      "weight": {"value": 60, "unit": "kg"}
    }
  }
  """
Then the response status should be 201
And the response should contain the added workout exercise
And the warmup exercise "High Knees" should be auto-added to warmup phase
And both exercises should have unique GUIDs
And the database should contain both exercises in the template
```

#### Scenario 2: Remove Workout Exercise with Orphan Cleanup
```gherkin
Given I am authenticated as "PT-Tier"
And a workout template exists with "Barbell Squat" in workout phase
And "High Knees" exists in warmup phase (auto-added)
And no other workout exercise uses "High Knees" as warmup
When I send a DELETE request to "/api/workout-templates/{templateId}/exercises/{exerciseGuid}"
Then the response status should be 200
And both "Barbell Squat" and "High Knees" should be removed
And the remaining exercises should maintain correct order
```

#### Scenario 3: Copy Round with New GUIDs
```gherkin
Given I am authenticated as "PT-Tier"
And a workout template has a workout round with 3 exercises
When I send a POST request to "/api/workout-templates/{templateId}/rounds/copy" with:
  """
  {
    "sourcePhase": "Workout",
    "sourceRoundNumber": 1,
    "targetPhase": "Workout",
    "targetRoundNumber": 2
  }
  """
Then the response status should be 201
And a new round 2 should exist with 3 exercises
And all exercises should have new GUIDs (different from source)
And all metadata should be preserved
```

#### Scenario 4: Reorder Exercise Within Round
```gherkin
Given I am authenticated as "PT-Tier"
And a workout template has exercises with OrderInRound [1,2,3,4]
When I send a PUT request to "/api/workout-templates/{templateId}/exercises/{exerciseGuid}/order" with:
  """
  {
    "newOrderInRound": 1
  }
  """
Then the response status should be 200
And the target exercise should have OrderInRound = 1
And other exercises should be reordered accordingly [2,3,4,5]
```

#### Scenario 5: Get Template Exercises Organized by Phase and Round
```gherkin
Given I am authenticated as "PT-Tier"
And a workout template has exercises across multiple phases and rounds
When I send a GET request to "/api/workout-templates/{templateId}/exercises"
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should be organized by phases: warmup, workout, cooldown
And each phase should contain rounds with exercises in correct order
And each exercise should include ExecutionProtocol-appropriate metadata
```

### Edge Cases to Test:
- [ ] Adding exercise to template in Production state (should fail)
- [ ] Removing exercise that doesn't exist
- [ ] Copying round to existing round number
- [ ] Auto-linking when warmup already exists manually
- [ ] Circular dependency prevention in auto-linking
- [ ] Empty metadata scenarios
- [ ] REST exercise handling with duration-only metadata
- [ ] Multiple rounds with same exercises (different metadata)
