## Decision

### Review Status: REQUIRES_CHANGES ‚ùå

### Reason for REQUIRES_CHANGES:
‚ùå **Critical Golden Rule Violation**: Class-level AutoMocker in ExerciseLinkMigrationCompatibilityTests violates Rule #13 (Test Independence)
‚ùå **Must fix before proceeding**: Shared mock state can cause test interdependencies and flaky tests
‚ùå **Pattern Violation**: Goes against established testing standards in the codebase

### Positive Aspects:
‚úÖ Excellent test coverage for migration scenarios
‚úÖ Comprehensive integration test suite with BDD scenarios
‚úÖ Outstanding Test Builder Pattern implementation
‚úÖ Proper backward compatibility testing
‚úÖ Clean interface design for handlers
‚úÖ Performance testing considerations

## Action Items

### IMMEDIATE (Must Fix):
1. **Fix Class-Level AutoMocker**: 
   - Refactor ExerciseLinkMigrationCompatibilityTests.cs to use method-level AutoMocker
   - Ensure each test creates its own AutoMocker instance
   - Remove shared _mocker and _sut fields
   - Update all test methods to follow pattern: `var autoMocker = new AutoMocker(); var sut = autoMocker.CreateInstance<ExerciseLinkService>();`

### RECOMMENDED (Should Fix):
1. **Enhance Mock Extensions**:
   - Create fluent extension for complex bidirectional setup validation
   - Reduce inline Setup() complexity in ExerciseLinkCommandDataServiceTests.cs

### OPTIONAL (Nice to Have):
1. **Configuration**: Make performance thresholds configurable
2. **Additional Scenarios**: Add more edge case testing

## Next Steps
- [x] Update task status in feature-tasks.md to reflect REQUIRES_CHANGES
- [ ] Fix class-level AutoMocker violation
- [ ] Re-run all tests to ensure independence
- [ ] Create new review after fixes are implemented
- [ ] Once APPROVED, proceed to feature completion

**Next Review Due**: After fixing critical AutoMocker violation

## Summary

This Phase 6 implementation demonstrates **excellent testing practices** with comprehensive BDD scenarios, outstanding Test Builder Pattern implementation, and thorough backward compatibility coverage. However, it contains **one critical violation** of the Golden Rule #13 regarding test independence that must be fixed before approval.

The integration test coverage is exceptional, covering all four link types, bidirectional operations, migration scenarios, and performance considerations. The Test Builder Pattern implementation is exemplary and should serve as a model for other features.

**Fix the AutoMocker issue and this will be ready for approval.**
