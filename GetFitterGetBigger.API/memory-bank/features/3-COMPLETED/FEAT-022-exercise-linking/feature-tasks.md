- **ExerciseLinkIntegrationTests**: 7 tests (CRUD operations)
- **ExerciseLinkCircularReferenceTests**: 4 tests (circular reference prevention)
- **ExerciseLinkDIConfigurationTests**: 6 tests (dependency injection)

## Time Tracking Summary
- **Total Estimated Time:** 16h 30m
- **Total Actual Time:** 2h 0m
- **AI Assistance Impact:** 87.9% reduction in time
- **Implementation Started:** 2025-07-09 10:15
- **Implementation Completed:** 2025-07-09 12:15

## Notes
- Circular reference detection is critical for data integrity
- Exercise type validation must be strictly enforced
- Consider caching for frequently accessed links (future enhancement)
- Suggested links feature can start simple and be enhanced later
- Authorization removed from endpoints as per user request (to be added later)
- Sequential operation tests better reflect real Admin UI usage patterns
- Soft delete operations are idempotent (multiple deletes return success)
