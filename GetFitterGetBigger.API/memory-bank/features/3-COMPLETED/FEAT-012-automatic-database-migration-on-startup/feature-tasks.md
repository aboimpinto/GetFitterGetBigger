### Implementation Guidelines

#### Migration Implementation
```csharp
// In Program.cs
try
{
    using var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();
    var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AppDbContext>();
    
    // This will create database if it doesn't exist and apply all pending migrations
    await context.Database.MigrateAsync();
    
    logger.LogInformation("Database migration completed successfully");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    logger.LogError(ex, "Database migration failed");
    // Exit gracefully to prevent running with mismatched schema
    Environment.Exit(1);
}
```

#### Key Decisions (Already Made)
1. **Migration Method**: Use `Migrate()` exclusively - supports migration history
2. **Failure Behavior**: Application exits on failure - prevents schema mismatches
3. **Concurrency**: Handled by EF Core automatically
4. **Rollback**: Automatic per-migration transaction rollback
5. **Configuration**: Standard appsettings.json, no special flags needed
6. **Monitoring**: Standard EF Core Debug logging is sufficient

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Database is created automatically on first run
- [ ] Pending migrations are applied on every startup
- [ ] Migration activities are logged clearly
- [ ] Application exits with clear error message on migration failure
- [ ] No manual database setup required
- [ ] Works in all environments (dev, staging, production)

### Estimated Effort
- Implementation: 4-6 hours
- Configuration: 2-3 hours  
- Testing: 4-6 hours
- Documentation: 1-2 hours
- **Total: 11-17 hours**

### Notes
- No complex configuration needed - keep it simple
- EF Core handles most complexity (concurrency, transactions)
- Focus on proper error handling and logging
- Remember: allowing startup with failed migrations causes data corruption
