## Time Tracking Summary
- **Total Estimated Time:** 25 hours (3 days)
- **Total Actual Time:** 2.5 hours
- **AI Assistance Impact:** 90% reduction in time
- **Implementation Started:** 2025-01-29 22:56
- **Implementation Completed:** 2025-01-29 23:08

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers:
1. **Docker not available in CI**: May need to configure CI environment
2. **Migration compatibility**: Some migrations might be PostgreSQL-specific
3. **Performance issues**: Container startup might be slow on some machines

### Contingency Plans:
1. **Hybrid approach**: Keep simple tests with In-Memory, complex ones with PostgreSQL
2. **Shared container**: Reuse container across test runs for performance
3. **Parallel limits**: Reduce parallel test execution if resource constrained

## Notes

- Found API bug in muscle group filter during testing - created separate todo item
- CI/CD configuration deferred as it requires access to GitHub Actions
- Performance is excellent with ~6.5 seconds for full test suite
- AI assistance provided massive time savings (90% reduction)
