## Critical Review Checklist

### 1. üö® RESOLVED: Service Repository Boundaries ‚úÖ ALL VIOLATIONS FIXED
**üìñ Source**: Updated `API-CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` - Service Repository Boundaries section

- [‚úÖ] **Single Repository Rule**: Service only accesses its own repository
- [‚úÖ] **Cross-Domain Access**: Via service dependencies, NOT direct repository access
- [‚úÖ] **Service Pattern**: All service methods return ServiceResult<T>
- [‚úÖ] **Layer Separation**: No cross-layer dependencies
- [‚úÖ] **DDD Compliance**: Domain logic in correct layer

**üéâ CRITICAL VIOLATIONS RESOLVED**:

#### **Previous Violation 1: WorkoutTemplateService.cs Line 772 - FIXED ‚úÖ**
```csharp
// ‚úÖ FIXED - Now uses service dependency instead of direct repository access
// OLD CODE (VIOLATION):
// var exerciseRepository = unitOfWork.GetRepository<IExerciseRepository>();

// NEW CODE (COMPLIANT):
var exercisesResult = await _exerciseService.GetPagedAsync(command);
```
**Resolution**: Replaced direct `IExerciseRepository` access with `IExerciseService` dependency

#### **Previous Violation 2: WorkoutTemplateService.cs Lines 827-828 - FIXED ‚úÖ** 
```csharp
// ‚úÖ FIXED - Now uses service dependencies instead of multiple repository access
// OLD CODE (VIOLATION):
// var templateExerciseRepository = unitOfWork.GetRepository<IWorkoutTemplateExerciseRepository>();
// var exerciseRepository = unitOfWork.GetRepository<IExerciseRepository>();

// NEW CODE (COMPLIANT):
var templateExercisesResult = await _workoutTemplateExerciseService.GetByWorkoutTemplateAsync(id);
// ... process template exercises, then for each exercise:
var exerciseDto = await _exerciseService.GetByIdAsync(exerciseId);
```
**Resolution**: Replaced direct repository access with proper service-to-service communication

#### **Previous Violation 3: Service Constructor - FIXED ‚úÖ**
```csharp
// ‚úÖ FIXED - Constructor now properly injects service dependencies
public WorkoutTemplateService(
    IUnitOfWorkProvider<FitnessDbContext> unitOfWorkProvider,
    IWorkoutStateService workoutStateService,
    IExerciseService exerciseService, // ‚Üê ADDED
