# SKIPPED: Feature Superseded by FEAT-007

## Reason for Skipping
This feature has been superseded by the work completed in FEAT-007 (Integration Tests EF Core Fix).

## Details
FEAT-009 was created to fix a single skipped test in CacheServiceTests:
- Test: `GetOrCreateAsync_WhenFactoryReturnsNull_DoesNotCache`
- Proposed solution: Create a new `GetOrCreateNullableAsync` method

However, FEAT-007's scope was expanded to fix ALL skipped tests in the project, including this CacheService test. The exact solution proposed in FEAT-009 (creating the `GetOrCreateNullableAsync` method) was implemented as part of FEAT-007.

## Current State
- The CacheService nullable test is now passing
- 0 skipped tests remain in the entire project
- All 477 tests are passing

## Decision
- Date: 2025-01-30
- Decided by: Paulo Aboim Pinto (Product Owner)
- Reason: Feature objectives already achieved in FEAT-007
