# FEAT-027: Domain Entity Caching Architecture

## Feature Overview

**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Architecture/Infrastructure  
**Effort**: Medium (12-16 hours)  
**Risk**: Low  

## Problem Statement

The current caching architecture only supports two of the three entity tiers defined in `THREE-TIER-ENTITY-ARCHITECTURE.md`:

- ✅ **Tier 1 (Pure References)**: `IEternalCacheService` with `CacheResult<T>` - 365-day TTL
- ✅ **Tier 2 (Enhanced References)**: `EnhancedReferenceService` with `ICacheService` - 1-hour TTL with invalidation
- ❌ **Tier 3 (Domain Entities)**: **NO CACHING CONCEPT EXISTS**

This gap became apparent during FEAT-026 implementation when attempting to add caching to `WorkoutTemplateService`. Domain entities like `Exercise`, `WorkoutTemplate`, `User`, and `WorkoutSession` have no established caching patterns, leading to:

1. **Inconsistent Implementation**: Developers may implement ad-hoc caching solutions
2. **Architecture Violations**: Using wrong cache services for wrong entity types
3. **Performance Gaps**: Domain entities that could benefit from caching have none
4. **Maintenance Issues**: No standard approach for cache invalidation in complex domain relationships

## Proposed Solution

Design and implement a comprehensive caching architecture for Domain Entities (Tier 3) that addresses their unique characteristics:

- User-created and modified data
- Complex relationships and business logic
- Frequent changes requiring sophisticated invalidation
- Selective caching needs (not all domain entities should be cached)

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Architecture Design
- [ ] Define `IDomainEntityCacheService` interface with `CacheResult<T>` pattern
- [ ] Create caching strategy options: None, Selective, Time-based, Event-based
- [ ] Design cache invalidation patterns for complex domain relationships
- [ ] Define cache key conventions for domain entities
- [ ] Document when/when not to cache domain entities

### 2. Implementation
- [ ] Implement `DomainEntityCacheService` with configurable strategies  
- [ ] Create `DomainEntityServiceBase` with optional caching support
- [ ] Add cache configuration options to `appsettings.json`
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation hooks for related entity changes

### 3. Guidelines & Documentation
- [ ] Update `THREE-TIER-ENTITY-ARCHITECTURE.md` with Tier 3 caching details
- [ ] Create `DOMAIN-ENTITY-CACHING-GUIDE.md` with implementation patterns
- [ ] Define performance metrics and monitoring for domain entity caches
- [ ] Provide migration guide for existing domain services

### 4. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for `DomainEntityCacheService` with all strategies
- [ ] Integration tests for cache invalidation scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing comparing cached vs non-cached domain operations
- [ ] Memory usage analysis for different cache strategies

## Technical Considerations

### Cache Strategy Options
1. **No Caching**: For frequently changing or user-specific data
2. **Short-Term Caching**: 5-minute TTL for read-heavy operations
3. **User-Scoped Caching**: Cache per user with user-based invalidation
4. **Relationship-Aware**: Invalidate based on related entity changes

### Invalidation Complexity
- Domain entities have complex relationships (WorkoutTemplate → Exercise → Equipment)
- Need dependency graph for cascading invalidation
- Consider event-driven invalidation vs polling-based approaches

### Memory Management
- Domain entities typically larger than reference data
- Need configurable cache size limits and eviction policies
- Consider distributed caching for multi-instance deployments

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All three entity tiers have consistent caching architecture
- [ ] Domain services can easily opt-in to appropriate caching strategies
- [ ] Cache hit ratios improve for read-heavy domain operations
- [ ] No ad-hoc caching implementations in domain services
- [ ] Clear guidelines prevent architecture violations like FEAT-026 issue

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Complete FEAT-026 without caching to establish baseline
- **Related**: May impact future Exercise service and User service implementations

## Risk Mitigation

- **Over-caching Risk**: Provide clear guidelines on when NOT to cache
- **Memory Risk**: Implement configurable limits and monitoring
- **Complexity Risk**: Start with simple strategies, evolve incrementally
- **Performance Risk**: Include comprehensive benchmarking

## Implementation Notes

This is a foundational architecture feature that will benefit:
- Current: WorkoutTemplate, Exercise services
- Future: User, WorkoutSession, Plan services  
- Overall: System performance and consistency

The architecture should be extensible to support future domain entity types without requiring major refactoring.
