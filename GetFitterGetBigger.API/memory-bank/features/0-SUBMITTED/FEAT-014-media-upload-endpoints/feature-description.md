# Feature: Media Upload API Endpoints

## Feature ID: FEAT-014
## Created: 2025-06-30
## Status: 0-SUBMITTED
## Target PI: TBD

## Description
Implementation of media upload endpoints to support exercise images and videos, including a processing pipeline for mobile optimization. This feature will enable users to upload, process, and serve media content associated with exercises.

## Business Value
- **Visual Exercise Instructions**: Users can see proper form through images and videos
- **Mobile Optimization**: Automatic media processing for optimal mobile performance
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Multiple media variants reduce data usage for mobile users
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Visual content significantly improves workout execution

## User Stories
- As a Personal Trainer, I want to upload exercise demonstration videos so that clients can see proper form
- As a Personal Trainer, I want to upload multiple images per exercise so that I can show different angles
- As a Mobile User, I want optimized media that loads quickly on my device
- As an API Consumer, I want to retrieve media in appropriate sizes for my use case

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Support file uploads up to 100MB for videos
- [ ] Accept common media formats (JPEG, PNG, MP4, MOV)
- [ ] Process uploaded media into multiple variants (thumbnail, small, medium, large)
- [ ] Compress videos to standard resolutions (720p, 1080p)
- [ ] Extract poster frames from videos
- [ ] Provide progress feedback for large uploads
- [ ] Support chunked uploads for reliability
- [ ] Clean up failed uploads automatically
- [ ] Serve media through optimized endpoints
- [ ] Integrate with exercise management

## Technical Specifications

### Endpoints
All endpoint designs are complete in `/api-docs/media-upload-endpoints.md`:

1. **Upload Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/media/upload` - Direct file upload
   - `POST /api/media/upload-url` - Pre-signed URL generation
   - `POST /api/media/upload/chunk` - Chunked upload support

2. **Media Serving**:
   - `GET /api/exercises/{id}/media` - Get all media variants
   - `GET /media/{type}/{exerciseId}/{filename}` - Serve specific files

### Processing Pipeline
- Image resizing to predefined dimensions
- Video compression with quality preservation
- Automatic format optimization
- Metadata extraction and storage

### Architectural Decisions Required
1. **Storage Backend**:
   - Local filesystem (simple but not scalable)
   - Azure Blob Storage (scalable but adds cost)
   - Hybrid approach (complexity vs flexibility)

2. **Processing Strategy**:
   - Synchronous processing (blocks upload)
   - Asynchronous with queues (more complex)
   - External service (additional cost)

3. **CDN Integration**:
   - Direct serving vs CDN
   - Caching strategies
   - Geographic distribution needs

## Dependencies
- Exercise management feature (for media associations)
- Storage infrastructure provisioning
- Media processing libraries:
  - ImageSharp or SkiaSharp for images
  - FFMpegCore for video processing
  - Azure.Storage.Blobs (if using Azure)

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Requires architectural decisions before implementation
- **Storage Costs**: Ongoing costs for cloud storage if chosen
- **Processing Load**: Server resources needed for media processing
- **Network Bandwidth**: Large file uploads may impact API performance

## Implementation Considerations
- Implement rate limiting for uploads
- Add virus scanning for uploaded files
- Consider watermarking for premium content
- Plan for storage cleanup policies
- Design for horizontal scaling

## Notes
This feature is currently blocked pending architectural decisions on storage backend and processing strategy. All technical analysis and endpoint documentation is complete. Once architectural decisions are made, implementation can proceed immediately.
