# Feature: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration with Docker Support

## Feature ID: FEAT-008
## Created: 2025-01-29
## Status: SUBMITTED
## Target PI: PI-2025-Q1

## Description

Configure GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the GetFitterGetBigger API project with full support for Docker-based integration tests using TestContainers.

## Business Value

- **Automated Quality Gates**: Ensure all tests pass before merging code
- **Continuous Integration**: Catch integration issues early
- **Deployment Automation**: Streamline deployment process
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintain code quality standards

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want automated tests to run on every PR so that I can catch issues early
- As a team lead, I want quality gates enforced so that only tested code reaches main branch
- As a DevOps engineer, I want Docker support in CI so that TestContainers-based tests can run

## Technical Requirements

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Build and test on every push and PR
- Support for Docker containers (required for TestContainers)
- Code coverage reporting
- Build artifacts generation

### Docker Configuration
- Docker service in GitHub Actions
- Support for PostgreSQL TestContainers
- Proper cleanup of containers after tests

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Minimum code coverage threshold
- Build must succeed with no errors
- Linting and code formatting checks

## Dependencies

- GitHub repository access
- GitHub Actions enabled
- Docker support in CI environment
- TestContainers.PostgreSql already implemented (FEAT-007)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow file created
- [ ] Docker service configured in workflow
- [ ] All integration tests run successfully in CI
- [ ] Build artifacts are generated
- [ ] Code coverage reports are generated
- [ ] PR checks are configured
- [ ] Documentation updated with CI/CD process

## Technical Considerations

- Need to ensure Docker-in-Docker works for TestContainers
- Consider caching Docker images for faster builds
- Set appropriate timeouts for container-based tests
- Configure proper secrets management for deployment

## Notes

- This feature depends on FEAT-007 (TestContainers implementation)
- Consider adding deployment stages in future iterations
- May need to adjust based on GitHub Actions limitations
