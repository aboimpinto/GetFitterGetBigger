# FEAT-012: Automatic Database Migration on Startup

## Feature ID: FEAT-012
## Submitted: 2025-01-30
## Status: SUBMITTED
## Priority: High
## Category: Infrastructure

## Description
Implement automatic database creation and migration handling during application startup to prevent runtime errors caused by missing database schemas or unapplied migrations.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the application can fail at runtime if:
- The database doesn't exist (first-time setup)
- Migrations haven't been applied
- New migrations are pending after deployment

This was demonstrated by BUG-007 where a missing migration caused the exercise endpoints to fail with "column m.CreatedAt does not exist" error.

## Proposed Solution
Add startup logic that:
1. Checks if the database exists
2. Creates the database if it doesn't exist
3. Applies all pending migrations automatically
4. Logs migration activities for monitoring
5. Optionally validates the schema matches the EF model

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application creates database on first run
- [ ] Application applies pending migrations on startup
- [ ] Migration process is logged clearly
- [ ] Startup fails gracefully if migrations cannot be applied
- [ ] Configuration option to disable auto-migration in production
- [ ] No manual intervention required for database setup

## Technical Considerations
- Use `context.Database.EnsureCreated()` or `context.Database.Migrate()`
- Consider performance impact on startup time
- Handle concurrent startup scenarios (multiple instances)
- Ensure proper error handling and rollback
- Add configuration flags for different environments

## Benefits
- Eliminates manual migration steps
- Prevents runtime errors from missing schemas
- Simplifies deployment process
- Improves developer experience
- Reduces support tickets

## Risks
- Auto-migration in production could be dangerous
- Startup time may increase
- Migration failures could prevent app startup
- Concurrent migrations need careful handling

## Dependencies
- Entity Framework Core
- Current migration system
- Application startup pipeline

## Notes
This feature would have prevented BUG-007 and similar issues. Consider adding:
- Migration history validation
- Schema drift detection
- Rollback capabilities
- Health check endpoint for migration status
