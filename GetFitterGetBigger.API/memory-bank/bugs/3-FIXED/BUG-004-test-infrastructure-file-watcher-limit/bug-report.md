# BUG-004: Test Infrastructure - File Watcher inotify Limit Exceeded

## Bug ID: BUG-004
## Reported: 2025-06-27
## Status: FIXED
## Severity: Critical
## Affected Version: Current Development Branch
## Fixed Version: 2025-06-27 (OS Configuration Fix)
## Fixed By: Paulo Aboim Pinto (OS inotify limit increase)

## Description
87 out of 349 tests (24.9%) are failing due to a system-level file watcher limit being exceeded. Tests cannot initialize their test hosting environment because the .NET configuration system is unable to create file change tokens for configuration monitoring.

## Error Message
```
System.IO.IOException : The configured user limit (128) on the number of inotify instances has been reached, or the per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.
  at System.IO.FileSystemWatcher.StartRaisingEvents()
  at Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Physical.PhysicalFilesWatcher.TryEnableFileSystemWatcher()
  at Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Physical.PhysicalFilesWatcher.CreateFileChangeToken(String filter)
  at Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.PhysicalFileProvider.Watch(String filter)
  at Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.FileConfigurationProvider.<.ctor>b__1_0()
```

## Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Cause**: The Linux system inotify limit (128 instances) is being exceeded during test execution. Each test that creates a TestHost/WebApplicationFactory is creating file watchers for configuration monitoring, and these are not being properly disposed between tests.

**Contributing Factors**:
1. **Test Infrastructure Design**: Tests are creating too many concurrent WebApplicationFactory instances
2. **Resource Leakage**: File watchers are not being properly disposed after test completion
3. **System Configuration**: Default Linux inotify limits are too low for intensive test scenarios
4. **Configuration Monitoring**: .NET's configuration system creates file watchers by default for hot reload functionality

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run `dotnet test` on the current codebase
2. Observe that tests start failing after approximately 128 test fixtures are created
3. Error: File watcher limit exceeded
4. Expected: All tests should pass with proper resource management
5. Actual: 87 tests fail due to infrastructure limitations

## Impact Assessment

### Users Affected
- **Developers**: Cannot reliably run the full test suite
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build failures due to test infrastructure issues
- **Code Quality**: Unable to verify code changes properly

### Features Affected
- **All Controllers**: Most controller tests are affected
- **Integration Tests**: Database and API integration tests failing
- **Reference Data Tests**: All reference data endpoint tests failing

### Business Impact
- **Development Velocity**: Severely impacted by unreliable test execution
- **Code Confidence**: Cannot trust test results
- **Release Quality**: Risk of shipping untested code

## Test Failure Breakdown

### Total Test Metrics (Before Fix)
- **Total Tests**: 349
- **Passed**: 253 (72.5%)
- **Failed**: 87 (24.9%)
- **Skipped**: 9 (2.6%)

### Total Test Metrics (After Fix)
- **Total Tests**: 349
- **Passed**: 334 (95.7%)
- **Failed**: 6 (1.7%) - **Different issues, created BUG-005**
- **Skipped**: 9 (2.6%)

### Failed Test Categories

#### Controller Tests (Majority - ~75 tests)
**Pattern**: All controller tests failing with identical inotify error
**Affected Controllers**:
- EquipmentController (4 variants)
- BodyPartsController (4 variants) 
- MetricTypesController (4 variants)
- MuscleRolesController (4 variants)
- MovementPatternsController (4 variants)
- DifficultyLevelsController (4 variants)
- MuscleGroupsController (4 variants)
- ExercisesController (multiple tests)
- BranchCoverageTests (multiple scenarios)

#### Integration Tests (~5 tests)
- DatabasePersistenceTest
- ExerciseCoachNotesSyncTests

#### Reference Data Tests (~7 tests)
- ReferenceDataDtoTests with multiple endpoints

## Workaround
**Temporary**: Run tests in smaller batches to avoid hitting the limit:
```bash
# Run tests by category to avoid resource exhaustion
dotnet test --filter "Category=Unit"
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration" 
```

**System Level**: Increase inotify limits (requires admin privileges):
```bash
# Temporary increase
echo 1024 | sudo tee /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances

# Permanent increase
echo "fs.inotify.max_user_instances = 1024" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

## Test Data
No specific test data required - the issue reproduces with any test execution that creates multiple WebApplicationFactory instances.

## Fix Summary
**FIXED on 2025-06-27 by Paulo Aboim Pinto via OS configuration change**

**Solution Applied**: Increased Linux inotify user instance limit from 128 to higher value
**Command Used**: `sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1024` (or similar)
**Result**: Test failure rate dropped from 24.9% (87 tests) to 1.7% (6 tests)

**Impact**: 
- 81 tests that were failing due to inotify limits are now PASSING
- Test success rate improved from 72.5% to 95.7%
- Only 6 tests remain failing (different root causes, tracked in BUG-005)

**Fix Type**: Infrastructure/OS configuration (not code change)
**Verification**: All previously failing inotify-related tests now pass consistently
