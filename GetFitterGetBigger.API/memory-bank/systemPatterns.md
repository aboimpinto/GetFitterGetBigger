# System Patterns

## Architectural Patterns
- **API-First Design**: The system is built around a central API that serves as the backbone for all operations
- **Three-Tier Architecture**: 
  1. Presentation Layer (Mobile App and Admin App)
  2. Business Logic Layer (API)
  3. Data Access Layer (Database, accessed only through API)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between client applications and server-side logic

## Design Patterns (Anticipated)
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection**: For loose coupling and testability
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Potentially for separating read and write operations
- **Mediator Pattern**: Potentially for handling communication between components

## Communication Patterns
- **RESTful API**: For standardized communication between clients and server
- **Request-Response**: Standard HTTP communication pattern
- **Authentication Flow**: (To be determined based on security requirements)

## Data Patterns
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: For transferring data between API and client applications
- **Entity Models**: For database representation
- **Data Validation**: Input validation at API boundaries

## User Interaction Patterns
- **Mobile-First Design**: For the client application
- **Dashboard Interface**: For the admin application
- **Workout Flow**: Sequential progression through exercise routines
