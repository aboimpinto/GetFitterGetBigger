# Code Quality Standards - GetFitterGetBigger API

**ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE**: This document has been reorganized into a unified structure across all GetFitterGetBigger projects.

## ðŸ“‹ New Structure

The code quality standards are now organized as follows:

1. **Universal Standards**: `/CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
   - Core principles that apply to ALL projects
   - Language-agnostic best practices
   - Universal architecture patterns

2. **API-Specific Standards**: `/memory-bank/API-CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md`
   - Empty/Null Object Pattern
   - ServiceResult Pattern
   - Unit of Work Pattern
   - Controller Standards
   - API Security & Performance

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Read These Documents Before Starting ANY Implementation

1. First, read the universal `CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` in the root repository
2. Then, read `API-CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` in this memory-bank for API-specific standards
3. Follow the `CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` for code review procedures

## ðŸ”„ Migration Note

The content that was previously in this file has been split into:
- Universal standards (moved to root repository)
- API-specific standards (moved to API-CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md)

This ensures consistency across all projects while maintaining specific requirements for each technology stack.
