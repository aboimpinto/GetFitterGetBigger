# Bug Implementation Process

This document outlines the standard process for fixing bugs in the GetFitterGetBigger API.

## Process Overview

### File Management Rules

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Maintain focus on REQUIRED files only! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

When implementing bug fixes:
- **Only create files explicitly required** by this process
- **DO NOT add extra documentation files** like README.md, notes.md, etc.
- **bug-report.md and bug-tasks.md** contain all necessary documentation
- **Avoid redundancy** - if information exists in required files, don't duplicate it elsewhere
- **Supporting files** (like error logs, test scripts) are allowed ONLY if they add unique value

Remember: Clean, focused file structure makes bugs easier to track and fix.

### 1. Bug Analysis & Planning
- User provides bug description with error details and reproduction steps
- Create a comprehensive bug fix plan with granular tasks
- **MANDATORY**: Create a bug tracking file at `memory-bank/bugs/BUG-[ID]-[descriptive-name]/bug-tasks.md`
- Each task must be marked with status `[TODO]`
- Tasks should be specific, actionable, and independently verifiable
- The bug file must include:
  - Bug branch name at the top
  - Bug description with full error details
  - Root cause analysis
  - Impact assessment
  - Tasks organized by logical categories (Test Creation, Fix Implementation, Verification)
  - **Failing test tasks MUST come before fix implementation**
  - Clear description of what each task entails
  - Test script for manual verification
  - Space for commit hashes to be added as tasks are completed

### 2. Branch Creation
- Create a dedicated bugfix branch from the current branch
- Naming convention: `bugfix/[descriptive-bug-name]`
- All bug fix work occurs in this isolated branch

### 3. Baseline Health Check (MANDATORY)
Before starting ANY bug fix:
1. **Run baseline health check**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet test
   ```
2. **Document results in bug-tasks.md**:
   ```markdown
   ## Baseline Health Check Report
   **Date/Time**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
   **Branch**: bugfix/branch-name

   ### Build Status
   - **Build Result**: ‚úÖ Success / ‚ùå Failed / ‚ö†Ô∏è Success with warnings
   - **Warning Count**: X warnings
   - **Warning Details**: [List specific warnings if any]

   ### Test Status
   - **Total Tests**: X
   - **Passed**: X
   - **Failed**: X (excluding the bug being fixed)
   - **Skipped/Ignored**: X
   - **Test Execution Time**: X.XX seconds

   ### Decision to Proceed
   - [ ] Build successful
   - [ ] No unrelated test failures
   - [ ] Warnings documented and approved

   **Approval to Proceed**: Yes/No
   ```

3. **Evaluation and Action**:
   - ‚úÖ **Build OK, Tests OK**: Proceed to bug fix
   - ‚ùå **Build Fails**: STOP - Fix build first (Task 0.1)
   - ‚ùå **Unrelated Tests Fail**: STOP - Fix other tests first (Task 0.2)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings Exist**: Document and apply Boy Scout Rule
     - Create Task 0.3+ for warning fixes
     - Fix warnings in touched files

### 4. Test-First Implementation Phase
- **CRITICAL**: Write failing tests FIRST that reproduce the bug
- Execute tasks sequentially from the bug tracking file

#### üìö Before Starting ANY Service Modifications:
- [ ] Read `/memory-bank/common-implementation-pitfalls.md`
- [ ] Review `/memory-bank/service-implementation-checklist.md`
- [ ] Remember: ReadOnlyUnitOfWork for queries, WritableUnitOfWork for saves ONLY

- **For EVERY task implementation:**
  1. If it's a test task: Write test that fails with the exact error described
  2. If it's a fix task: Implement the minimum code to make tests pass
     - **‚ö†Ô∏è For service fixes: Use the service-implementation-checklist.md**
  3. **MANDATORY: Keep build warnings to a minimum**
  4. **MANDATORY: Run `dotnet build` to ensure compilation succeeds**
  5. **MANDATORY: Run `dotnet test` to verify test status**
  6. Commit the changes with descriptive message
  7. Update task status from `[TODO]` to `[IMPLEMENTED: <git-commit-hash>]`
- Task progression states:
  - `[TODO]` - Task identified and ready to implement
  - `[PROGRESS]` - Currently working on this task
  - `[IMPLEMENTED: <hash>]` - Task completed with reference commit
  - `[BLOCKED: <reason>]` - Task cannot be completed due to dependency

### 5. Test Development Rules
- **First tests MUST fail** with the same error as the bug report
- Tests should cover:
  - The exact scenario that triggered the bug
  - Edge cases related to the bug
  - Regression prevention
- If a test cannot be written due to technical limitations:
  - Mark as `[BLOCKED: <detailed-reason>]`
  - Create a new bug entry for the blocker
  - Link both bugs bidirectionally

### 6. Fix Verification Phase
- After fix implementation:
  - ALL tests must be GREEN (no failures, no skipped)
  - Build must succeed with minimal warnings
  - Manual test script must execute successfully
- Only when ALL tests pass, return control to user

### 7. Manual Testing Phase
- Provide user with:
  - The test script from the bug file
  - Expected API behaviors
  - Steps to verify the fix
  - Any additional verification steps
- Wait for user acceptance before proceeding

### 8. Quality Comparison Report (MANDATORY)
After all bug fix tasks are complete, add to bug-tasks.md:
```markdown
## Implementation Summary Report
**Date/Time**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Duration**: X days/hours

### Quality Metrics Comparison
| Metric | Baseline | Final | Change |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Build Warnings | X | Y | -Z |
| Test Count | X | Y | +Z |
| Test Pass Rate | X% | 100% | +Z% |
| Skipped Tests | X | Y | -Z |

### Quality Improvements
- Fixed X build warnings in touched files
- Added Y new tests for bug fix
- Fixed Z unrelated failing tests
- [Other improvements]

### Boy Scout Rule Applied
- ‚úÖ All issues in touched files fixed
- ‚úÖ Bug properly tested
- ‚úÖ No regression introduced
```

### 9. Bug Finalization
After user confirms bug is fixed:
1. Update bug file status to `[FIXED]`
2. Merge bugfix branch into original branch
3. Create descriptive commit message referencing BUG-ID
4. Delete the bugfix branch locally

### 10. Handling Blocked Bugs
When a bug cannot be fixed due to dependencies:
1. Mark the bug overall status as `[BLOCKED: <reason>]`
2. Create new bug entry for the blocker with:
   - Bug ID and description
   - Link to the blocked bug
   - Expected resolution approach
3. Update the blocking bug/feature to reference this blocked bug
4. When blocker is resolved:
   - Resume from the blocked task
   - Update status to continue implementation

## Bug Status Definitions
- `[TODO]` - Task identified and ready to implement
- `[PROGRESS]` - Currently working on this task
- `[IMPLEMENTED: <hash>]` - Task completed with reference commit
- `[BLOCKED: <reason>]` - Task blocked by external dependency
- `[FIXED]` - Bug completely resolved and verified

## Bug File Template

```markdown
# BUG-[ID]: [Short Description]

## Bug Branch: `bugfix/[descriptive-name]`

## Bug Description
[Detailed description of the bug including error message or console output]

## Root Cause
[Analysis of why the bug occurs]

## Bug Impact
- [Impact on users]
- [Impact on system]
- [Affected features]

## üìö Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Read `/memory-bank/common-implementation-pitfalls.md`
- [ ] Review `/memory-bank/service-implementation-checklist.md`
- [ ] Understand ReadOnly vs Writable UnitOfWork pattern
- [ ] Run baseline health check

[Actual test commands or manual steps]
```

## Prevention Measures
[List measures to prevent similar bugs]

## Notes
[Any additional context or considerations]
```

## Important Rules
1. **Tests First**: Always write failing tests before implementing fixes
2. **Green Tests**: Bug is only fixed when ALL tests pass
3. **Minimal Fix**: Implement the minimum code needed to fix the bug
4. **No Regression**: Ensure fix doesn't break existing functionality
5. **Documentation**: Always document the fix and prevention measures

## Verification Checklist

Before marking bug as `[FIXED]`:
- [ ] Failing tests written that reproduce the bug
- [ ] Fix implemented that makes tests pass
- [ ] ALL tests are GREEN (no failures, no skipped)
- [ ] `dotnet build` runs without errors
- [ ] Build warnings are minimal
- [ ] Manual test script executes successfully
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated with fix details

## API-Specific Considerations

### API Bug Fixes
- Test across different HTTP methods
- Verify proper status codes
- Check error response formats
- Test with different authentication roles

### Integration Testing
- Use test fixtures appropriately
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error handling paths
- Verify database transactions

### Performance
- Ensure fix doesn't introduce performance issues
- Check for N+1 query problems
- Verify no memory leaks
- Test with realistic data volumes
