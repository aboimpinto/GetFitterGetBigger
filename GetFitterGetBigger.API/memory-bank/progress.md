# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Initial project setup with C# Minimal API and Swagger
- Memory bank documentation created to capture project context

## Completed Items
- Project structure established
- Basic documentation created
- Documented database model implementation pattern using Entity Framework Core
- Established coding standards for the project
- Implemented core entity models for the fitness domain:
  - Exercise and related entities (MovementPattern, MuscleGroup, Equipment, MetricType)
  - User entity
  - Workout logging entities (WorkoutLog, WorkoutLogSet)
  - Linking entities for many-to-many relationships
- Implemented specialized ID types for all entities
- Implemented enums for categorization (DifficultyLevel, KineticChainType, BodyPart, MuscleRole)
- Replaced enums with reference data tables for better extensibility
- Integrated Olimpo.EntityFramework.Persistency library for UnitOfWork pattern
- Implemented base repository interface and implementation for reference data
- Implemented specific repositories for reference data entities:
  - DifficultyLevel
  - KineticChainType
  - BodyPart
  - MuscleRole
  - Equipment
  - MetricType
  - MovementPattern
  - MuscleGroup
- Created separate controllers for each reference data type:
  - DifficultyLevelsController
  - KineticChainTypesController
  - BodyPartsController
  - MuscleRolesController
  - EquipmentController
  - MetricTypesController
  - MovementPatternsController
  - MuscleGroupsController
- Documented UnitOfWork pattern implementation in unitOfWorkPattern.md
- Fixed ID formatting in API responses to use the `<referencetable>-<guid>` format
- Tested reference data endpoints and confirmed proper functionality
- Refactored controllers to follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Created a base controller (ReferenceTablesBaseController) for all reference table controllers
- Configured Swagger UI to group all reference table controllers under a "ReferenceTables" section
- Implemented hierarchical structure in Swagger UI for reference table controllers
- Created custom Swagger filters to organize reference table endpoints
- Tested the grouped controllers in Swagger UI and confirmed proper functionality
- Updated all reference table controllers to properly handle prefixed ID format (`<referencetable>-<guid>`)
- Added proper validation and error handling for ID parsing in all controllers
- Updated documentation to reflect the ID format requirements and benefits
- Fixed test cases to properly handle the specialized ID format
- Implemented comprehensive tests for all reference data controllers
- Ensured all tests pass for reference data retrieval operations
- Enhanced specialized ID types with TryParse methods for better validation
- Improved ReferenceDataDto to exclude internal properties (DisplayOrder, IsActive) from API responses
- Updated ReferenceTablesBaseController.MapToDto method to use ToString() for ID formatting
- Added XML documentation to ReferenceDataDto properties
- Created comprehensive tests to verify DTO structure and ID formatting
- Updated memory bank documentation to reflect DTO structure changes
- Implemented case-insensitive searches for all reference data "ByValue" endpoints
- Added tests to verify case-insensitive behavior of value searches
- Updated documentation to specify case-insensitive search behavior
- Updated non-ReferenceDataBase entity controllers (Equipment, MetricType, MovementPattern, MuscleGroup) to use consistent API patterns
- Added ByValue endpoints to all non-ReferenceDataBase entity controllers for consistency
- Ensured all reference data controllers return data in a consistent format using ReferenceDataDto
- Created comprehensive documentation of the UnitOfWork pattern in unitOfWorkPattern.md
- Updated tests to handle empty database scenarios, making them more robust for different environments
- Implemented JWT authentication and authorization (Note: A bug regarding test run is still open and will be fixed later.)

## In Progress

### Authentication System Restoration
- **Description:** Restore the JWT authentication system that was accidentally removed during cleanup. The system will generate JWT tokens and return user claims, but will NOT enforce authorization yet.
- **Todo List:**
  1. ✅ Analyze what authentication components exist vs what was removed
  2. ✅ Restore AuthController with login endpoint
  3. ✅ Restore DTOs (AuthenticationRequest, AuthenticationResponse, ClaimInfo)
  4. ✅ Restore AuthService and IAuthService
  5. ✅ Restore JwtService and IJwtService
  6. ✅ Add JWT configuration back to appsettings
  7. ✅ Register auth services in DI container
  8. ✅ Test authentication endpoint returns JWT and claims
  9. ✅ Do NOT add [Authorize] attributes yet
- **Status:** COMPLETED - Authentication system restored and working. JWT tokens are generated but not enforced.

### Other Tasks
- Implementing repositories and services for the remaining non-reference data entities

## Proposed Features

### Server-Side Caching for Reference Tables

To improve performance and reduce database load, a server-side caching mechanism will be implemented directly within the API for the reference table endpoints.

*   **Mechanism:** The implementation will use `IMemoryCache` provided by ASP.NET Core. Controllers responsible for reference data will query the cache before falling back to a database query.
*   **Cache Invalidation Strategy:**
    *   **Static Tables:** Data for tables that rarely or never change (e.g., `BodyParts`, `DifficultyLevels`) will be cached with a long-term expiration (e.g., 24 hours).
    *   **Dynamic Tables:** For tables that are updated more frequently (e.g., `Equipment`), a shorter cache duration will be used. Crucially, any API endpoint that modifies this data (e.g., via `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) will be responsible for explicitly invalidating the corresponding cache key. This ensures that clients always receive fresh data after a modification.

## New Tasks

*   **Task:** Implement Exercise Management Feature (API)
    *   **Description:** Implement the `Exercise` entity, repository, service, and controller as detailed in the `features/exercise-management.md` document. This includes creating the database table, implementing all business logic, and exposing the necessary API endpoints.
    *   **Status:** `[SUBMITTED]`

*   **Task:** Implement Server-Side Caching for Reference Tables
    *   **Description:** Implement the server-side caching strategy as outlined in the "Proposed Features" section. This includes using `IMemoryCache` in the reference table controllers and implementing the cache invalidation logic for dynamic tables.
    *   **Status:** `[SUBMITTED]`

## Next Steps
- Implement repositories and controllers for the remaining entities (Exercise, User, WorkoutLog, etc.)
- Implement business logic for workout planning and tracking
- Set up authentication and authorization
- Develop and test API endpoints for workout management
- Document API with Swagger
- Implement validation for entity creation and updates
- Implement additional reference data repositories as needed

## Open Questions
- Specific features required for the mobile and admin applications
- Deployment strategy
- Additional entities needed for workout templates and programs
- Reporting and analytics requirements
- Performance optimization for reference data retrieval
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed reference data
