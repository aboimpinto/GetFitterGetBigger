# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Initial project setup with C# Minimal API and Swagger
- Memory bank documentation created to capture project context

## Completed Items
- Project structure established
- Basic documentation created
- Documented database model implementation pattern using Entity Framework Core
- Established coding standards for the project
- Implemented core entity models for the fitness domain:
  - Exercise and related entities (MovementPattern, MuscleGroup, Equipment, MetricType)
  - User entity
  - Workout logging entities (WorkoutLog, WorkoutLogSet)
  - Linking entities for many-to-many relationships
- Implemented specialized ID types for all entities
- Implemented enums for categorization (DifficultyLevel, KineticChainType, BodyPart, MuscleRole)
- Replaced enums with reference data tables for better extensibility
- Integrated Olimpo.EntityFramework.Persistency library for UnitOfWork pattern
- Implemented base repository interface and implementation for reference data
- Implemented specific repositories for reference data entities:
  - DifficultyLevel
  - KineticChainType
  - BodyPart
  - MuscleRole
  - Equipment
  - MetricType
  - MovementPattern
  - MuscleGroup
- Created separate controllers for each reference data type:
  - DifficultyLevelsController
  - KineticChainTypesController
  - BodyPartsController
  - MuscleRolesController
  - EquipmentController
  - MetricTypesController
  - MovementPatternsController
  - MuscleGroupsController
- Documented UnitOfWork pattern implementation in unitOfWorkPattern.md
- Fixed ID formatting in API responses to use the `<referencetable>-<guid>` format
- Tested reference data endpoints and confirmed proper functionality
- Refactored controllers to follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Created a base controller (ReferenceTablesBaseController) for all reference table controllers
- Configured Swagger UI to group all reference table controllers under a "ReferenceTables" section
- Implemented hierarchical structure in Swagger UI for reference table controllers
- Created custom Swagger filters to organize reference table endpoints
- Tested the grouped controllers in Swagger UI and confirmed proper functionality
- Updated all reference table controllers to properly handle prefixed ID format (`<referencetable>-<guid>`)
- Added proper validation and error handling for ID parsing in all controllers
- Updated documentation to reflect the ID format requirements and benefits
- Fixed test cases to properly handle the specialized ID format
- Implemented comprehensive tests for all reference data controllers
- Ensured all tests pass for reference data retrieval operations
- Enhanced specialized ID types with TryParse methods for better validation
- Improved ReferenceDataDto to exclude internal properties (DisplayOrder, IsActive) from API responses
- Updated ReferenceTablesBaseController.MapToDto method to use ToString() for ID formatting
- Added XML documentation to ReferenceDataDto properties
- Created comprehensive tests to verify DTO structure and ID formatting
- Updated memory bank documentation to reflect DTO structure changes
- Implemented case-insensitive searches for all reference data "ByValue" endpoints
- Added tests to verify case-insensitive behavior of value searches
- Updated documentation to specify case-insensitive search behavior
- Updated non-ReferenceDataBase entity controllers (Equipment, MetricType, MovementPattern, MuscleGroup) to use consistent API patterns
- Added ByValue endpoints to all non-ReferenceDataBase entity controllers for consistency
- Ensured all reference data controllers return data in a consistent format using ReferenceDataDto
- Created comprehensive documentation of the UnitOfWork pattern in unitOfWorkPattern.md
- Updated tests to handle empty database scenarios, making them more robust for different environments
- Restored JWT authentication system after accidental removal
  - Restored AuthController with login endpoint
  - Restored authentication DTOs (AuthenticationRequest, AuthenticationResponse, ClaimInfo)
  - Restored AuthService and JwtService implementations
  - Configured JWT settings in appsettings
  - JWT tokens are generated but authorization is not enforced (Note: A bug regarding authorization enforcement is still open)
- Implemented server-side caching for reference tables
  - Added IMemoryCache configuration to reduce database load
  - Static tables (DifficultyLevels, KineticChainTypes, BodyParts, MuscleRoles) cached for 24 hours
  - Dynamic tables (Equipment, MetricTypes, MovementPatterns, MuscleGroups) cached for 1 hour
  - All reference table controllers now use caching infrastructure
  - Created comprehensive cache invalidation strategy for future CRUD operations
  - Added cache configuration to appsettings.json
  - Created cache service with error resilience and logging

## In Progress

### Other Tasks
- Implementing repositories and services for the remaining non-reference data entities

## Proposed Features

## New Tasks

*   **Task:** Implement Exercise Management Feature (API)
    *   **Description:** Implement the `Exercise` entity, repository, service, and controller as detailed in the `features/exercise-management.md` document. This includes creating the database table, implementing all business logic, and exposing the necessary API endpoints.
    *   **Status:** `[SUBMITTED]`

*   **Task:** Implement Server-Side Caching for Reference Tables
    *   **Description:** Implement the server-side caching strategy as outlined in the "Proposed Features" section. This includes using `IMemoryCache` in the reference table controllers and implementing the cache invalidation logic for dynamic tables.
    *   **Status:** `[COMPLETED]` - Merged to master

## Next Steps
- Implement repositories and controllers for the remaining entities (Exercise, User, WorkoutLog, etc.)
- Implement business logic for workout planning and tracking
- Set up authentication and authorization
- Develop and test API endpoints for workout management
- Document API with Swagger
- Implement validation for entity creation and updates
- Implement additional reference data repositories as needed

## Open Questions
- Specific features required for the mobile and admin applications
- Deployment strategy
- Additional entities needed for workout templates and programs
- Reporting and analytics requirements
- Performance optimization for reference data retrieval
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed reference data
