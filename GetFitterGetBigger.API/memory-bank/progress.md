# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Initial project setup with C# Minimal API and Swagger
- Memory bank documentation created to capture project context

## Completed Items
- Project structure established
- Basic documentation created
- Documented database model implementation pattern using Entity Framework Core
- Established coding standards for the project
- Implemented core entity models for the fitness domain:
  - Exercise and related entities (MovementPattern, MuscleGroup, Equipment, MetricType)
  - User entity
  - Workout logging entities (WorkoutLog, WorkoutLogSet)
  - Linking entities for many-to-many relationships
- Implemented specialized ID types for all entities
- Implemented enums for categorization (DifficultyLevel, KineticChainType, BodyPart, MuscleRole)

## In Progress
- Implementing database context and configurations
- Implementing repositories and services for the entities

## Next Steps
- Implement database migrations
- Implement API controllers for the entities
- Implement business logic for workout planning and tracking
- Set up authentication and authorization
- Develop and test API endpoints
- Document API with Swagger
- Implement validation for entity creation and updates

## Open Questions
- Database technology selection (SQL Server anticipated)
- Authentication mechanism
- Specific features required for the mobile and admin applications
- Deployment strategy
- Integration details with the UnitOfWork pattern
- Additional entities needed for workout templates and programs
- Reporting and analytics requirements
