# ExerciseBuilderSteps Pattern Documentation

## Overview

The ExerciseBuilderSteps pattern is a proven BDD integration testing approach that solves the **hardcoded ID problem** when migrating complex integration tests to SpecFlow. This pattern was developed during the FEAT-024 BDD migration project and successfully migrated over 50 complex exercise-related integration tests.

## The Problem

Original integration tests used hardcoded GUIDs for reference data IDs:

```csharp
// ❌ PROBLEMATIC: Hardcoded GUIDs that break in BDD environment
DifficultyLevelId.From(Guid.Parse("8a8adb1d-24d2-4979-a5a6-0d760e6da24b"))
KineticChainTypeId.From(Guid.Parse("12345678-9abc-def0-1234-567890abcdef"))
```

These hardcoded values work in isolation but fail in BDD tests because:
- TestContainers creates fresh databases with different seeded IDs
- Seed data uses dynamic ID generation
- Foreign key constraints reject invalid references

## The Solution: ExerciseBuilderSteps Pattern

### Core Components

1. **Dynamic ID Resolution via SeedDataBuilder.StandardIds**
2. **Business-Friendly Gherkin Steps**
3. **Fluent Builder Integration**
4. **Scenario Context State Management**

### Key Features

```csharp
// ✅ SOLUTION: Dynamic resolution using seed data references
var difficultyId = difficultyName.ToLower() switch
{
    "beginner" => SeedDataBuilder.StandardIds.DifficultyLevelIds.Beginner,
    "intermediate" => SeedDataBuilder.StandardIds.DifficultyLevelIds.Intermediate,
    "advanced" => SeedDataBuilder.StandardIds.DifficultyLevelIds.Advanced,
    _ => throw new ArgumentException($"Unknown difficulty level: {difficultyName}")
};
```

## Step Definition Examples

### Exercise Creation Steps

```csharp
[Given(@"I have an exercise named ""(.*)""")]
[When(@"I create a (workout|rest|warmup|cooldown) exercise named ""(.*)""")]
[When(@"I set the difficulty to ""(.*)""")]
[When(@"I add muscle group ""(.*)""() as ""(.*)""")]
[When(@"I submit the exercise")]
```

### Exercise Link Management Steps

```csharp
[Given(@"I have created a link from ""(.*)""() to ""(.*)""() with link type ""(.*)""() and display order (\d+)")]
[When(@"I create an exercise link from ""(.*)""() to ""(.*)""() with link type ""(.*)""() and display order (\d+)")]
[When(@"I get all links for exercise ""(.*)""()")]
[Then(@"the exercise link should be created successfully")]
```

### Business Rule Validation Steps

```csharp
[When(@"I create an exercise with rest and other types")]
[When(@"I update exercise with rest type and other types")]
[Then(@"the request should fail with bad request")]
```

## Gherkin Examples

### Simple Exercise Creation
```gherkin
Given I have an exercise named "Bench Press" with exercise types "Workout"
When I set the difficulty to "Intermediate"
And I add muscle group "Chest" as "Primary"
And I submit the exercise
Then the exercise should be created successfully
```

### Complex Business Rules
```gherkin
Given I have an exercise named "Complex A" with exercise types "Workout,Warmup"
And I have an exercise named "Complex B" with exercise types "Workout,Warmup,Cooldown"
And I have created a link from "Complex A" to "Complex B" with link type "Warmup" and display order 1
When I create an exercise link from "Complex B" to "Complex A" with link type "Warmup" and display order 1
Then the response status should be "bad request"
And the response should contain "circular reference"
```

### REST Exercise Validation
```gherkin
Given I create a rest exercise named "Rest Period"
When I add exercise type "Workout"
And I submit the exercise  
Then the response status should be "bad request"
And the response should contain "REST exercises cannot be combined"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Identify Hardcoded IDs
```bash
# Find problematic patterns
grep -r "Guid.Parse" GetFitterGetBigger.API.Tests/IntegrationTests/
grep -r "Id.From(" GetFitterGetBigger.API.Tests/IntegrationTests/
```

### 2. Create Business-Friendly Steps
- Use domain language (not technical IDs)
- Support multiple exercise types in comma-separated format
- Handle complex scenarios (REST exclusivity, circular references)

### 3. Leverage Seed Data Standards
```csharp
// Always use SeedDataBuilder.StandardIds for dynamic resolution
SeedDataBuilder.StandardIds.ExerciseTypeIds.Workout
SeedDataBuilder.StandardIds.DifficultyLevelIds.Beginner
SeedDataBuilder.StandardIds.MuscleGroupIds.Chest
```

### 4. State Management
```csharp
// Store created entities for later reference
_scenarioContext.Set(exerciseId, $"Exercise_{exerciseName}_Id");

// Retrieve for linking operations  
var sourceExerciseId = _scenarioContext.Get<string>($"Exercise_{exerciseName}_Id");
```

## Success Metrics

### Migrations Completed Using This Pattern
- **ExerciseIntegration**: 9/9 tests ✅
- **ExerciseLinks**: 8/8 tests ✅ 
- **ExerciseLinkCircularReference**: 5/5 tests ✅
- **ExerciseCompleteWorkflow**: 3/3 tests ✅
- **ExerciseTypesAssignment**: 4/5 tests ✅
- **RestMuscleGroupValidation**: 3/4 tests ✅
- **ExerciseRestExclusivity**: 5/5 tests ✅

### Key Achievements
- **91.3% Migration Completion**: 199/218 tests migrated
- **Zero Test Failures**: All migrated tests pass consistently
- **Business Rule Coverage**: Complex validation logic preserved
- **Maintainability**: Human-readable test scenarios

## Pattern Benefits

### ✅ Advantages
- **Business Readable**: Tests describe behavior, not implementation
- **Maintainable**: No hardcoded values to update
- **Robust**: Works across different environments and data states
- **Reusable**: Steps can be combined for complex scenarios
- **Debuggable**: Clear failure messages with business context

### ⚠️ Considerations
- **Initial Setup**: Requires comprehensive step definition library
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Gherkin syntax
- **Exercise Type Rules**: Must understand business constraints (e.g., REST exclusivity)

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- Use business domain language in step definitions
- Leverage SeedDataBuilder.StandardIds for all reference data
- Create reusable steps for common operations
- Store entity IDs with descriptive keys in ScenarioContext
- Test business rules, not just happy paths
- Handle exercise type compatibility (target must support link type)

### Don'ts ❌
- Never use hardcoded GUIDs in step definitions
- Don't bypass API validation (use endpoints, not direct DB)
- Don't create overly specific steps (keep them reusable)
- Avoid technical implementation details in Gherkin

## Future Migrations

This pattern is ready for use on remaining integration tests:
- ExerciseLinkSequentialOperationsTests.cs (5 tests)
- ExerciseLinkEndToEndTests.cs (2+ tests)  
- Any future complex integration scenarios

The pattern scales well and has proven effective for scenarios involving:
- Multiple entity relationships
- Complex business rule validation
- Sequential operations
- State-dependent testing
- Error condition validation
