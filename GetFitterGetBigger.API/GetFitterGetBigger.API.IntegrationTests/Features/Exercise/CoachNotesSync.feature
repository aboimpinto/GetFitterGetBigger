Feature: Exercise Coach Notes Synchronization
  As a fitness application
  I want to manage coach notes with proper ordering
  So that users receive instructions in the correct sequence

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated as a user
    And the database has reference data
    # Get actual muscle group and role IDs from the database
    When I send a GET request to "/api/ReferenceTables/MuscleGroups"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And I store the first item from the response as "firstMuscleGroup"
    When I send a GET request to "/api/ReferenceTables/MuscleRoles"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And I store the first item from the response as "firstMuscleRole"
