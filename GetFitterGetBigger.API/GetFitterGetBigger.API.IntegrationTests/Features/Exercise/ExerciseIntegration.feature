Feature: Exercise Integration
  As a fitness application
  I want to manage exercises with various attributes
  So that I can provide comprehensive exercise information

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated as a user
    And the database has reference data
    # Get actual IDs from the database
    When I send a GET request to "/api/ReferenceTables/MuscleGroups"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And I store the first item from the response as "firstMuscleGroup"
    When I send a GET request to "/api/ReferenceTables/MuscleRoles"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And I store the first item from the response as "firstMuscleRole"
    When I send a GET request to "/api/ReferenceTables/ExerciseTypes"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And I store the first item from the response as "firstExerciseType"
