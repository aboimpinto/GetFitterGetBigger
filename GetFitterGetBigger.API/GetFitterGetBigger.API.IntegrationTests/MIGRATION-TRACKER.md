# Integration Test Migration Tracker

This document tracks the migration of existing integration tests from `GetFitterGetBigger.API.Tests` to the new BDD format in `GetFitterGetBigger.API.IntegrationTests`.

## Migration Analysis Summary

**Analysis Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Baseline Coverage**: 89.99% (765 total tests)  
**Migration Status**: **üéâ FIRST MIGRATION COMPLETE!**

### üéØ **MILESTONE ACHIEVED** (Commit: 8dac951e)
üéâ **FIRST MIGRATION 100% COMPLETE**: DifficultyLevelsControllerTests ‚Üí DifficultyLevels.feature  
‚úÖ **ALL 11 BDD Tests PASSING**: Complete API functionality proven  
‚úÖ **FULL FEATURE COVERAGE**: All original test scenarios migrated successfully  
üöÄ **Infrastructure VALIDATED**: BDD framework + real API endpoints working perfectly  

**Key Achievement**: First complete integration test migration with 100% success rate!

### ‚úÖ **STEP DEFINITION ISSUE RESOLVED**
**Initial Analysis Error**: Originally stated "advanced scenarios - refinement needed"  
**Actual Root Cause**: MissingStepDefinitionException - missing GIVEN patterns for HTTP requests  
**Resolution**: Added `[Given(...)]` attributes to RequestSteps.cs and ResponseSteps.cs  
**Lesson Learned**: Always provide accurate technical analysis; avoid speculation (documented in ACCURACY-IN-FAILURE-ANALYSIS.md)

### ‚úÖ **BUG-001 RESOLVED: JSON Property Casing**
**Final Issue**: Placeholder resolution property name casing mismatch  
**Root Cause**: 
- API returns JSON with lowercase properties: `{"id": "...", "value": "..."}`
- BDD placeholders used uppercase: `<firstDifficultyLevel.Id>`, `<firstDifficultyLevel.Value>`
- Placeholders worked in URLs but failed in assertions

**Solution Applied**:
1. Updated placeholders to lowercase: `<firstDifficultyLevel.id>`, `<firstDifficultyLevel.value>`
2. Added placeholder resolution to response assertion step definitions

**Result**: **ALL 11 BDD TESTS PASSING** ‚úÖ

**API Endpoints Confirmed Working**:
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/ReferenceTables/DifficultyLevels` (get all)
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/ReferenceTables/DifficultyLevels/{id}` (get by ID)  
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/ReferenceTables/DifficultyLevels/ByValue/{value}` (get by value)

### Categorized Migration Plan

## 1. Priority 1: Core API Endpoints (Ready to Migrate)
*Tests that verify working API endpoints and should be migrated first*

### Authentication & Authorization
| Original Test | File | BDD Feature | Priority | Complexity | Status |
|--------------|------|-------------|----------|------------|---------|
| `Login_WithValidRequest_ReturnsOkResult` | AuthControllerTests.cs | Authentication.feature | HIGH | Low | ‚ùå Not Started |
| `Login_WithInvalidRequest_ReturnsUnauthorized` | AuthControllerTests.cs | Authentication.feature | HIGH | Low | ‚ùå Not Started |
| `Login_WithNullRequest_ReturnsBadRequest` | AuthControllerTests.cs | Authentication.feature | HIGH | Low | ‚ùå Not Started |

**BDD Feature Example**:
```gherkin
Feature: Authentication
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    When I send a POST request to "/api/auth/login" with body:
      """
      {
        "email": "test@example.com"
      }
      """
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response should have property "token"
    And the response should have property "claims"
```

### Equipment Management
| Original Test | File | BDD Feature | Priority | Complexity | Status |
|--------------|------|-------------|----------|------------|---------|
| `GetAll_ReturnsAllEquipment` | EquipmentControllerCrudTests.cs | EquipmentManagement.feature | HIGH | Low | ‚ùå Not Started |
| `Create_WithValidData_ReturnsCreatedResult` | EquipmentControllerCrudTests.cs | EquipmentManagement.feature | HIGH | Medium | ‚ùå Not Started |
| `Update_WithValidData_ReturnsOkResult` | EquipmentControllerCrudTests.cs | EquipmentManagement.feature | HIGH | Medium | ‚ùå Not Started |

### Reference Tables (10 controllers)
| Controller | Tests | BDD Feature | Priority | Complexity | Status |
|------------|-------|-------------|----------|------------|---------|
| BodyPartsController | 8 tests | ReferenceData/BodyParts.feature | MEDIUM | Low | ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (10 BDD tests) |

## Migration Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Target**: Get basic infrastructure working with real API endpoints

1. **Authentication Tests** (3 tests)
   - Start with login endpoint (most critical)
   - Verify JWT token generation works
   - Test authorization for protected endpoints

2. **Simple Reference Tables** (5 controllers, ~35 tests)
   - BodyParts, DifficultyLevels, KineticChainTypes, MetricTypes, MuscleRoles
   - These are typically simple CRUD operations
   - Good for validating BDD infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 3-4)
**Target**: Migrate main business functionality

1. **Equipment Management** (11 tests)
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Validation scenarios

2. **MuscleGroups & ExerciseWeightTypes** (28 tests)
   - More complex reference data with business rules

3. **Basic Exercise Operations** (verify which endpoints exist)
   - Start with simple GET operations
   - Progress to POST/PUT if endpoints are ready

### Phase 3: Complex Features (Week 5-6)
**Target**: Advanced business logic (if APIs are ready)

1. **Exercise Weight Type Integration** (21 tests)
2. **Exercise Links** (25 tests) - **IF** business logic is implemented
3. **Complex Workflows** (7 tests) - **IF** workflows are implemented

### Phase 4: Infrastructure & Cleanup (Week 7)
**Target**: Complete migration and cleanup

1. **Database Tests** (8 tests) - adapted for TestContainers
2. **Migration Validation** - ensure coverage parity
3. **Old Test Removal** - clean up original tests

## Migration Guidelines

### For Each Test Migration:

1. **Analyze Original Test**:
   ```bash
   # Review the test purpose and verify API endpoint exists
   curl -X GET http://localhost:5214/api/[endpoint]
   ```

2. **Create BDD Scenario**:
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: [Business scenario description]
     Given [preconditions]
     When [action]
     Then [expected outcome]
   ```

3. **Implement Missing Steps**:
   - Only add new step definitions if existing ones don't cover the scenario
   - Reuse existing patterns from Authentication/Request/Response steps

4. **Validate Equivalent Coverage**:
   ```bash
   # Run original test
   dotnet test --filter "ClassName.TestName"
   
   # Run new BDD test
   dotnet test GetFitterGetBigger.API.IntegrationTests --filter "TestCategory=specific"
   ```

5. **Update Tracker**:
   - Mark as ‚úÖ Completed with commit hash
   - Document any issues or differences

### Coverage Tracking

#### Baseline Metrics
- **Total Tests**: 765 (before migration)
- **Coverage**: 89.99%
- **Integration Tests**: ~218 (IntegrationTests + Controllers)

#### Migration Metrics (Updated Weekly)
- **Tests Migrated**: 18/218 (8.2%)
- **Coverage After Migration**: TBD
- **BDD Tests Created**: 22 (DatabaseConnection + DifficultyLevels + BodyParts)

### Risk Mitigation

#### High Risk Areas
1. **Exercise Operations** - Many tests may reference unimplemented endpoints
2. **Complex Business Logic** - Exercise links, workflows may be partially implemented
3. **Authorization** - Need to verify which endpoints require which roles

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **API Endpoint Verification**: Test each endpoint manually before migration
2. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate working endpoints first, skip problematic ones
3. **Stakeholder Verification**: Confirm authorization requirements for each endpoint
4. **Coverage Monitoring**: Ensure coverage doesn't drop below 89.99%

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Infrastructure setup and working
- Example BDD test (DatabaseConnection) 
- Step definitions for common scenarios
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

### üöß In Progress  
- **Task 8**: Migration planning and analysis

### ‚è≥ Next Steps
1. Start Phase 1: Authentication endpoint verification and migration
2. Verify which reference table endpoints are functional
3. Create first real BDD scenario for working endpoint
4. Establish migration workflow and validation process

### üìä Success Metrics
- [ ] Phase 1 Complete: Authentication + 5 reference tables migrated
- [ ] Coverage maintained above 89.99%
- [ ] All migrated tests pass in CI/CD
- [ ] No functional regressions introduced
