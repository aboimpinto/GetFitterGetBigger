## üîß Basic CRUD Operations

### Create Entity

```gherkin
Feature: Exercise Management
  As a personal trainer
  I want to manage exercises
  So that I can create workout plans

Scenario: Create a new exercise successfully
  Given I am authenticated as a "PT-Tier"
  And the database has reference data
  When I send a POST request to "/api/exercises" with body:
    """
    {
      "name": "Bench Press",
      "description": "Classic chest exercise",
      "difficultyId": "difficultylevel-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
      "kineticChainId": "kineticchaintype-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
      "exerciseTypeIds": ["exercisetype-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"],
      "isUnilateral": false
    }
    """
  Then the response status should be 201
  And the response should have property "id"
  And the response should have property "name" with value "Bench Press"
  And the database should contain 1 exercise records
```

### Read Entity

```gherkin
Scenario: Get exercise by ID
  Given I am authenticated as a "Free-Tier"
  And the following exercise exists:
    | Name        | Description         | DifficultyLevel |
    | Pull-ups    | Upper body compound | Advanced        |
  When I send a GET request to "/api/exercises/<Pullups.Id>"
  Then the response status should be 200
  And the response should have property "name" with value "Pull-ups"
  And the response should have property "description" with value "Upper body compound"
```

```

## üéØ Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Use Background** for common setup
2. **Use Scenario Outlines** for data-driven tests
3. **Store intermediate values** for multi-step workflows
4. **Test both success and failure paths**
5. **Verify database state** after operations
6. **Use meaningful test data** that explains the scenario
7. **Include authorization tests** for all endpoints
8. **Test edge cases** and boundary conditions

## üìù Notes

- Replace ID placeholders with actual IDs from your system
- Adjust endpoints to match your actual API routes
- Verify authorization rules with stakeholders
- Add more examples as new patterns emerge
