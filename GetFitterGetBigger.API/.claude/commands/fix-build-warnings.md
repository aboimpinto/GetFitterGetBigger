# Fix Build Warnings

Please help me fix all build warnings in the GetFitterGetBigger.API project.

## Process:
1. First, run `dotnet clean` to ensure a fresh build
2. Then run `dotnet build` to see all current warnings
3. Analyze and categorize the warnings
4. Fix each warning systematically, starting with the most critical ones
5. Run the build again to verify all warnings are resolved

## Important Notes:
- Some warnings may require code refactoring or adding nullable annotations
- Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality
- Update relevant tests if needed
- Common warning types include: unused variables, nullable reference warnings, obsolete API usage, and missing XML documentation

Please provide a summary of warnings found and the fixes applied.
