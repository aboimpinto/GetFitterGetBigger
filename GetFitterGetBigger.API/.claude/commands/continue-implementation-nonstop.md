Continue implementing the current feature through ALL remaining tasks without stopping at checkpoints.

Instructions:
1. Identify the current feature in /memory-bank/features/2-IN_PROGRESS/
2. Review ALL remaining tasks in feature-tasks.md
3. Implement each task sequentially without stopping
4. Run tests after each major component
5. Only stop if there's an error or all tasks are complete

Nonstop mode behavior:
- Skip checkpoint confirmations
- Continue through all categories
- Auto-commit at logical points with descriptive messages
- Run tests automatically between components
- Update feature-tasks.md as tasks complete

Quality safeguards:
- Still follow CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md
- Run tests between major changes
- Stop if tests fail
- Stop if compilation errors occur
- Create code review notes for later review

When to stop:
- All tasks completed
- Test failures that can't be immediately fixed
- Compilation errors
- Missing dependencies or blockers
- Architectural decisions needed

Progress reporting:
- Provide summary after each category
- List completed tasks
- Report test results
- Note any issues encountered

Warning: This mode implements everything without user review. Ensure you're confident in the implementation approach before using.
