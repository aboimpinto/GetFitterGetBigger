Triggers the feature-implementation-executor agent to continue implementing the current in-progress feature.

## What this command does:
Delegates to the @feature-implementation-executor agent which will:

1. **Identify** the current feature in /memory-bank/features/2-IN_PROGRESS/
2. **Find** the next uncompleted task or checkpoint in feature-tasks.md
3. **Validate** checkpoint requirements (including automated code reviews)
4. **Execute** implementation following CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md
5. **Test** comprehensively with proper coverage
6. **Review** code automatically via @code-reviewer agent at checkpoints
7. **Update** task status and checkpoint information
8. **Stop** at checkpoints for validation and user confirmation

## Agent Invocation:
This command triggers:
```
@feature-implementation-executor
```

## Key Features of the Agent:
- ✅ **Automated Code Reviews** at every checkpoint
- ✅ **Git Commit Hash** enforcement (mandatory for traceability)
- ✅ **APPROVED_WITH_NOTES** handling (requires user confirmation)
- ✅ **Quality Gates** (0 errors, 0 warnings, all tests passing)
- ✅ **Task Tracking** via TodoWrite integration
- ✅ **No Task Left Behind** policy
- ✅ **CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md** strict enforcement

## Checkpoint Behavior:
- Stops at phase checkpoints for validation
- Triggers @code-reviewer for automated review
- Creates git commits with proper format
- Updates feature-tasks.md with status
- Handles three review outcomes:
  - **APPROVED**: Proceeds to next phase
  - **APPROVED_WITH_NOTES**: Requests user confirmation
  - **REQUIRES_CHANGES**: Fixes issues before proceeding

## If No Feature in Progress:
The agent will:
- Check /memory-bank/features/1-READY_TO_DEVELOP/
- Inform user if no active feature found
- Suggest using /start-implementing for new features

## Usage:
Simply run this command and the agent will handle everything systematically.
