Refine a feature in SUBMITTED status to prepare it for development.

Usage: /refine-feature [FEAT-XXX or feature name]

Instructions:
1. Locate the feature in /memory-bank/features/0-SUBMITTED/
2. Review and enhance the feature-description.md
3. Create detailed feature-tasks.md with implementation steps
4. Identify dependencies and technical requirements
5. Move to 1-READY_TO_DEVELOP when refinement is complete

Refinement activities:
- **Clarify Requirements**: Ensure acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- **Break Down Tasks**: Create detailed implementation tasks by category
- **Identify Dependencies**: List required features, APIs, or libraries
- **Architecture Impact**: Document any architectural changes needed
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential challenges or blockers
- **Test Strategy**: Define unit and integration test approach
- **API Design**: If applicable, design endpoint contracts
- **Database Changes**: Document any schema modifications

Task categories to create:
1. Models & Entities
2. Database & Migrations
3. Repositories
4. Services
5. Controllers/Endpoints
6. Unit Tests
7. Integration Tests
8. Documentation

After refinement:
- Feature should be fully specified
- All tasks clearly defined
- Ready for estimation and implementation
- Move to 1-READY_TO_DEVELOP folder

The feature is now ready for /start-implementing command.
