You will perform a comprehensive code review for the specified feature using the feature-code-reviewer agent.

**Report Naming Convention**: 
- First review of the day: `code-review-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Subsequent reviews same day: `code-review-report-YYYY-MM-DD-001.md`, `code-review-report-YYYY-MM-DD-002.md`, etc.

When the user types `/review-feature FEAT-XXX [options]`, you should:

1. **Parse Command Options**:
   - `--incremental`: Review only new commits since last review
   - `--fix-only`: Only review files from Code Review Fixes phase
   - `--quick`: Use Sonnet model for faster (less thorough) review
   - `--thorough`: Force Opus 4.1 model for maximum accuracy (default)
   - Default to full review with Opus 4.1 if no flags provided
   
   Examples:
   - `/review-feature FEAT-030` - Full review with Opus 4.1
   - `/review-feature FEAT-030 --incremental` - Incremental review with Opus 4.1
   - `/review-feature FEAT-030 --quick` - Full review with Sonnet (faster)
   - `/review-feature FEAT-030 --incremental --quick` - Quick incremental review

2. **Find the Feature Folder**:
   - Search in /memory-bank/features/ subdirectories (0-SUBMITTED, 1-READY_TO_DEVELOP, 2-IN_PROGRESS, 3-COMPLETED, 4-BLOCKED, 5-SKIPPED)
   - Confirm the feature exists
   - Check if previous review reports exist (for incremental reviews)

3. **Pre-Review Checks**:
   - Check if feature-tasks.md exists and has commits
   - If incremental, verify previous review report exists
   - Note current phase and any existing Code Review Fixes phase

4. **Launch the Review Agent**:
   - Use the Task tool to launch the 'feature-code-reviewer' agent
   - If `--quick` flag is used:
     - Override agent's default model by specifying in prompt:
       "Use Sonnet model for this quick review. Focus on critical violations."
     - Note: The agent defaults to Opus 4.1 for thorough reviews
   - Provide clear instructions including:
     - Feature folder path
     - Review type (initial/incremental)
     - Model preference (if --quick flag used)
     - Last reviewed commit (if incremental)
   - Ask it to return:
     - Report path
     - Summary of findings
     - Number of tasks created
     - Critical violations list
     - Model used for review

5. **Verify Report Generation**:
   - Check if the code review report was created in the feature folder
   - Report will be named using pattern: `code-review-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - If multiple reviews on same day: `code-review-report-YYYY-MM-DD-001.md`, `code-review-report-YYYY-MM-DD-002.md`, etc.
   - If not found in expected location, check agent output and save it yourself
   - Verify fix tasks were added to feature-tasks.md if violations found

6. **Update Feature Tasks or Phase Checkpoint**:
   - Check if feature has `Phases/` directory:
     - If yes: Find active phase document and update its checkpoint
     - Look for `## CHECKPOINT:` section in the phase document
     - Update the phase checkpoint, NOT feature-tasks.md
   - If no phases: Update feature-tasks.md as before
   - If initial review: Add report link in Code Review checkpoint
   - If incremental: Update existing checkpoint with new iteration
   - If violations found: Verify "Code Review" section exists
     - Each review adds a numbered entry with status and summary
   - Add review commit hash for tracking

7. **Provide Enhanced Summary to User**:
   - Feature reviewed with type (Initial/Incremental)
   - Report location
   - Build and test status
   - Overall approval rate (and improvement if incremental)
   - Number of unique files reviewed
   - Number of critical violations
   - Number of fix tasks created
   - Recommendation with clear next steps
