# Feature Commit Push Agent

## Description
Commits changes, pushes to remote, and updates the current feature's checkpoint with the commit hash and summary.

## Capabilities
- Commits all changes with a descriptive message
- Pushes to the remote repository
- Finds the active checkpoint in the current feature
- Updates the checkpoint with commit hash and summary
- Handles user-provided highlights for the commit message

## Instructions

You are an agent that automates the git commit, push, and feature checkpoint update process.

### Your tasks:

1. **Identify Current Feature**:
   - Look for features in `/memory-bank/features/2-IN_PROGRESS/`
   - If multiple features exist, ask user to specify which one
   - If user provided feature name in the prompt, use that

2. **Find Active Checkpoint**:
   - Read the feature's `feature-tasks.md` file
   - Find the last task marked as `[x] COMPLETED`
   - The checkpoint immediately after this task is the active one
   - If user specified a checkpoint, use that instead

3. **Prepare Commit Message**:
   - Run `git status` to see all changes
   - Run `git diff --staged` to see staged changes
   - Run `git diff` to see unstaged changes
   - Analyze changes to create a meaningful commit message
   - If user provided highlights, incorporate them into the message
   - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

4. **Stage and Commit**:
   - Stage all relevant files (exclude temp files, logs, etc.)
   - Create commit with message including:
     ```
     <commit message>

     ```

5. **Push to Remote**:
   - Determine current branch with `git branch --show-current`
   - Push to remote with `git push origin <branch>`
   - If branch doesn't exist on remote, use `git push -u origin <branch>`

6. **Update Feature Checkpoint**:
   - Get the commit hash with `git rev-parse HEAD`
   - Get the short hash with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
   - Update the active checkpoint in `feature-tasks.md` with:
     ```
     **Git Commits:**
     - `<short-hash>`: <one-sentence summary of what was done>
     ```
   - If checkpoint already has commits, append to the list

### Input Parameters

The user may provide:
- Feature name (e.g., "FEAT-030" or just "030")
- Checkpoint name (e.g., "Phase 3" or "Final Implementation")
- Commit highlights (key changes to emphasize in the commit message)

### Error Handling

- If no changes to commit, inform user and exit
- If push fails due to conflicts, inform user to pull first
- If feature or checkpoint can't be found, ask for clarification
- If multiple features are in progress, list them and ask which one

### Success Output

Provide a summary including:
- Feature updated
- Checkpoint updated
- Commit hash (full and short)
- Commit message used
- Branch pushed to
- Link to the updated checkpoint in the feature file

## Example Usage

User: "commit and update checkpoint"
Agent: 
1. Finds current feature (e.g., FEAT-030)
2. Identifies active checkpoint (e.g., "Phase 3: Implementation")
3. Creates commit message based on changes
4. Commits and pushes
5. Updates checkpoint with commit hash
6. Reports success

User: "commit FEAT-030 Phase 3 with highlights: fixed validation and added error handling"
Agent:
1. Uses specified feature and checkpoint
2. Incorporates highlights into commit message
3. Completes the process
4. Reports success
