# Kinetic Chain Admin Requirements

## Overview
The Kinetic Chain feature in the Admin application enables Personal Trainers to properly categorize exercises based on their biomechanical properties, improving workout design and exercise selection.

## User Interface Updates

### Exercise List View Enhancement
**Filter Addition:**
- Add "Kinetic Chain" filter dropdown
- Options: All, Compound, Isolation
- Filter persists across sessions
- Quick filter badges

**List Display:**
- Show kinetic chain badge on exercise cards
- Color coding: Compound (blue), Isolation (orange)
- Sort option by kinetic chain type
- Group view option by kinetic chain

### Exercise Form Enhancement
**Kinetic Chain Field:**
- Position: After Exercise Type selection
- Field type: Required dropdown (for non-REST exercises)
- Dynamic visibility: Hidden when REST type selected
- Help text: "Select whether this exercise works multiple muscle groups (Compound) or focuses on a single muscle (Isolation)"

**Validation UI:**
- Red border when required but not selected
- Clear error message below field
- Auto-focus on validation error
- Contextual help icon with examples

### Exercise Detail View
**Display Enhancement:**
- Kinetic chain badge in header section
- Icon representation (interconnected circles for Compound, single circle for Isolation)
- Tooltip with description on hover
- Related exercises by kinetic chain section

## Features

### Smart Categorization
**Auto-suggestion Logic:**
- When multiple muscle groups marked as "Primary" → Suggest Compound
- When single muscle group marked as "Primary" → Suggest Isolation
- PT can override suggestion
- Learn from PT corrections over time

### Bulk Operations
**Kinetic Chain Assignment:**
- Select multiple exercises
- Bulk assign kinetic chain type
- Preview affected exercises
- Validation before applying
- Undo capability

### Exercise Templates
**Template Enhancement:**
- Include kinetic chain in exercise templates
- Filter templates by kinetic chain
- Template categories: "Compound Movements", "Isolation Work"

## Workflows

### Creating Exercise with Kinetic Chain
1. PT starts creating new exercise
2. Fills basic information
3. Selects exercise type(s)
4. If REST type selected:
   - Kinetic chain field hidden
   - Automatically set to null
5. If non-REST type:
   - Kinetic chain field appears
   - Required field indicator shown
   - PT selects Compound or Isolation
6. System validates selection
7. Exercise created with classification

### Filtering by Kinetic Chain
1. PT navigates to exercise library
2. Clicks kinetic chain filter
3. Selects desired type(s)
4. List updates to show filtered results
5. Can combine with other filters
6. Clear filter option available

### Workout Design Integration
1. In workout builder
2. PT can filter available exercises by kinetic chain
3. See balance of compound vs isolation in workout
4. Get suggestions for kinetic chain variety
5. Warning if workout lacks compound movements

## Display Guidelines

### Visual Indicators
**Compound Exercises:**
- Badge: Blue background, white text
- Icon: Multiple interconnected nodes
- Description: "Multi-muscle movement"

**Isolation Exercises:**
- Badge: Orange background, white text  
- Icon: Single node with radiating lines
- Description: "Single-muscle focus"

### Educational Elements
**Tooltips:**
- Hover over kinetic chain badge for explanation
- Examples of each type
- Benefits of each approach

**Help Documentation:**
- In-app guide to kinetic chain concepts
- Best practices for workout balance
- Common categorization examples

## Permissions
- View kinetic chain: All authenticated users
- Set kinetic chain: PT-Tier, Admin-Tier
- Bulk update: Admin-Tier only
- No special permissions required beyond exercise CRUD

## Mobile Considerations
**Responsive Design:**
- Kinetic chain badges scale appropriately
- Filter dropdown optimized for touch
- Swipe to filter by kinetic chain
- Clear visual distinction on small screens

**Performance:**
- Cache kinetic chain types locally
- Include in offline exercise data
- Efficient filtering on device

## Reporting Features
**Analytics Integration:**
- Exercise library composition (Compound vs Isolation)
- PT preference patterns
- Workout balance analytics
- Client performance by exercise type

**Export Options:**
- Include kinetic chain in exercise exports
- Filter exports by kinetic chain
- Summary reports by classification
