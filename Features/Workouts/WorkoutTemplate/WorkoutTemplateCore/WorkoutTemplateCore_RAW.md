# Workout Template Core: Creating Reusable Workout Blueprints

## Introduction

The Workout Template Core feature represents the heart of the workout management system within the GetFitterGetBigger ecosystem. This feature provides the comprehensive infrastructure for creating, managing, and executing structured workout blueprints that serve as the foundation for actual workout logging and client training programs.

A workout template is a sophisticated, reusable blueprint that defines not just what exercises to perform, but how, when, and with what intensity. The challenge lies in creating a data model that captures the vast complexity of modern training methodologies—from simple bodyweight routines to complex periodized programs with advanced set protocols—while remaining intuitive for Personal Trainers to create and modify.

This document focuses on the core entities and business logic required to model comprehensive workout templates that can be seamlessly executed across mobile, web, and desktop client applications.

## Part I: The Anatomy of a Workout Template

### 1.1 The `WorkoutTemplate` Entity

The WorkoutTemplate serves as the master blueprint for any workout session. It contains the workout's metadata, defines its purpose, and establishes the framework within which exercises are organized and executed.

**Business Purpose:**
A workout template encapsulates the trainer's expertise and programming knowledge into a reusable format. It ensures consistency across training sessions, enables progressive overload tracking, and provides clear guidance for both trainers and clients.

*   **`Notes`:** Specific instructions for this set group

**Execution Protocol Integration:**
The ExecutionProtocolID links to standardized execution methods defined in the Workout Reference Data feature. This foreign key relationship ensures consistent protocol interpretation across all platforms while enabling the SetGroup to leverage sophisticated training methodologies including Standard, AMRAP, EMOM, ForTime, Tabata, Cluster, DropSet, and RestPause protocols.

The specific protocol selected determines how the TargetSets, TargetReps, TargetDurationSeconds, and RestBetweenSetsSeconds values are interpreted during workout execution. For detailed protocol definitions and execution instructions, see the ExecutionProtocol reference table in the Workout Reference Data feature.

### 1.4 Exercise Weight Type Integration

The Workout Template Core feature integrates with the existing ExerciseWeightType reference system to ensure logical consistency between exercise selection and weight prescription within workout templates.

**ExerciseWeightType Integration:**
Each exercise in the system includes an `ExerciseWeightTypeID` foreign key reference to the ExerciseWeightType reference table. This established system governs weight validation rules and UI behavior, preventing illogical combinations like prescribing external weight for bodyweight-only exercises.

The SetGroup validation leverages the existing ExerciseWeightType business rules to ensure proper weight assignment based on the exercise's weight requirements. For complete details on weight type validation rules and UI adaptations, see the ExerciseWeightType reference documentation.
