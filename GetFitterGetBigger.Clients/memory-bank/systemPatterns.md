# System Patterns

## System Architecture:
The application will follow a modular architecture, with separate modules for workout planning, nutritional guidance, progress tracking, and user management. Each module will be responsible for a specific set of functionalities and will communicate with other modules through well-defined interfaces.

## Key Technical Decisions:
- Using Avalonia UI for cross-platform UI development.
- Using C# for backend development.
- Using SQLite for local data storage.
- Using RESTful APIs for communication with external services.

## Design Patterns in Use:
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) for UI development.
- Dependency Injection (DI) for managing dependencies.
- Repository pattern for data access.
- Observer pattern for event handling.

## Component Relationships:
- The UI will interact with the ViewModels, which will in turn interact with the Models and Repositories.
- The Repositories will interact with the local database and external APIs.
- The Event Aggregator will be used to facilitate communication between different modules.

## Critical Implementation Paths:
- User authentication and authorization.
- Workout plan generation and execution.
- Nutritional data retrieval and display.
- Progress tracking and visualization.
