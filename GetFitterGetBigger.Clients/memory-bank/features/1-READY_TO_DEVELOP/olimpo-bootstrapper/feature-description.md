# Feature: Olimpo Bootstrapper

## Feature ID: FEAT-004
## Created: 2025-06-01
## Status: READY_TO_DEVELOP
## Target PI: PI-2025-Q2
## Platforms: Mobile, Web, Desktop

## Description
Application initialization system that manages the startup sequence of the application. Handles dependency registration, service initialization, and ensures all components are ready before the application becomes interactive.

## Business Value
- Consistent startup experience across platforms
- Proper dependency initialization order
- Better error handling during startup
- Faster perceived startup time with proper loading states

## User Stories
- As a user, I want the app to start quickly so that I can begin using it immediately
- As a user, I want to see loading progress so that I know the app is working
- As a developer, I want controlled initialization so that dependencies are ready when needed
- As a developer, I want startup error handling so that issues are caught early

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sequential initialization of services
- [ ] Parallel initialization where possible
- [ ] Progress reporting during startup
- [ ] Error handling with recovery options
- [ ] Configurable initialization steps
- [ ] Platform-specific optimizations

## Platform-Specific Requirements
### Mobile
- Splash screen integration
- Background initialization
- Memory-efficient startup

### Web
- Progressive loading
- Service worker initialization
- Browser compatibility checks

### Desktop
- Native splash window
- Multi-window initialization
- System tray integration

## Technical Specifications
- IBootstrapper interface
- Bootstrap step registration
- Progress reporting mechanism
- Dependency resolution
- Error recovery strategies

## Dependencies
- Olimpo IoC container
- Platform-specific startup APIs

## Notes
- Should integrate with existing navigation and event systems
- Consider lazy loading for non-critical services
