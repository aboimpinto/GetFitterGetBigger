## Feature ID: FEAT-007
## Created: 2025-06-15
## Status: READY_TO_DEVELOP
## Target PI: PI-2025-Q2
## Platforms: Mobile, Web, Desktop

## Description
Data synchronization system for retrieving workouts from the API and managing local/remote data consistency. Handles online/offline scenarios, conflict resolution, and efficient data updates.

## Business Value
- Always up-to-date workout library
- Seamless offline to online transition
- Reduced data usage with smart sync
- Data consistency across devices

## User Stories
- As a user, I want my workouts to sync automatically so that I have the latest data
- As a user, I want to work offline and sync later so that I'm not dependent on internet
- As a user, I want to see sync status so that I know when data is updated
- As a user, I want conflicts resolved automatically so that I don't lose data
