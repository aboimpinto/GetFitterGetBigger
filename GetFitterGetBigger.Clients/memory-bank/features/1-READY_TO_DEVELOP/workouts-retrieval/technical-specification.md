# Workouts Retrieval Feature

This document outlines the implementation of the workout retrieval feature, which is responsible for fetching workout data from a remote server and persisting it locally.

## Requirements

*   When the application starts, it should check for internet access.
*   If internet access is available, the application should download the latest workout data from a remote server.
*   The downloaded workout data should be persisted in a JSON structure within the file system.
*   If there is no internet access, or if no new workouts are available, the application should load workout data from the local file system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Internet Connection Check

*   Use a platform-specific API to check for internet connectivity.
*   Consider using a library or service for cross-platform compatibility.

### 2. Workout Data Download

*   Use an HTTP client (e.g., `HttpClient`) to fetch workout data from the server.
*   The server endpoint should return workout data in a defined JSON format.
*   Handle potential network errors (e.g., timeouts, connection errors).

### 3. Data Persistence

*   Serialize the downloaded workout data to JSON format.
*   Use the file system API to save the JSON data to a local file.
*   Consider using a dedicated directory for storing workout data.

### 4. Data Loading

*   When the application starts, attempt to load workout data from the local file.
*   If the local file exists, deserialize the JSON data into workout objects.
*   If the local file does not exist or if there is an error during deserialization, use default or pre-loaded workout data.

### 5. Versioning and Updates

*   Implement a versioning mechanism to determine if new workout data is available on the server.
*   Compare the local version with the server version before downloading new data.
*   Update the local version after a successful download.

### 6. Error Handling

*   Implement robust error handling for network requests, file system operations, and data parsing.
*   Log errors for debugging and monitoring.
*   Provide user feedback in case of errors.

### 7. Security Considerations

*   If the workout data contains sensitive information, consider encrypting the data both in transit and at rest.
*   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoint.

## Next Steps

*   Implement the internet connection check.
*   Implement the HTTP client to fetch workout data.
*   Define the JSON structure for workout data.
*   Implement the data persistence logic.
*   Implement the data loading logic.
*   Implement the versioning mechanism.
