# Reference Table Inline Creation - Client Tasks

## Overview

This feature is primarily for the Admin application. Client applications have minimal tasks, mostly related to testing compatibility with expanded reference data.

## Tasks

### 1. Compatibility Testing
- [ ] [TODO] Test client apps with expanded reference data sets
  - Verify dropdowns handle 100+ equipment items
  - Check performance with larger muscle group lists
  - Ensure UI remains responsive

### 2. API Integration Verification
- [ ] [TODO] Verify existing reference data endpoints continue working
  - GET /api/Equipment
  - GET /api/MuscleGroups
  - GET /api/MetricTypes
  - GET /api/MovementPatterns

### 3. Cache Behavior Validation
- [ ] [TODO] Confirm 1-hour cache for dynamic reference tables works correctly
- [ ] [TODO] Test app behavior when reference data updates mid-session

### 4. Documentation Updates
- [ ] [TODO] Update client documentation if any issues found
- [ ] [TODO] Note in release notes that PTs can now customize reference data

## No Implementation Required

Client applications do not need to implement any new features for this capability. The inline creation is Admin-only functionality.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Compatibility testing completed
- [ ] No regression in reference data handling
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with larger datasets
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
