# Feature: Olimpo Event Aggregator

## Feature ID: FEAT-002
## Created: 2025-04-15
## Status: COMPLETED
## Target PI: PI-2025-Q1
## Platforms: Mobile, Web, Desktop

## Description
Event aggregation system for loosely coupled communication between components. Implements a publish-subscribe pattern allowing different parts of the application to communicate without direct dependencies.

## Business Value
- Improved code maintainability through decoupling
- Easier testing with isolated components
- Flexible architecture for future features
- Consistent messaging across platforms

## User Stories
- As a developer, I want to publish events without knowing subscribers so that components remain decoupled
- As a developer, I want to subscribe to events without knowing publishers so that I can react to system changes
- As a developer, I want async event handling so that UI remains responsive

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Components can publish events
- [x] Components can subscribe to events
- [x] Supports both sync and async handlers
- [x] Type-safe event handling
- [x] Memory-efficient subscription management
- [x] Works across all platforms

## Platform-Specific Requirements
### Mobile
- Handles app lifecycle events
- Works with React Native bridge

### Web

- IHandleAsync<T> for async handlers
- Weak reference support for subscriptions
- Generic event types

## Dependencies
