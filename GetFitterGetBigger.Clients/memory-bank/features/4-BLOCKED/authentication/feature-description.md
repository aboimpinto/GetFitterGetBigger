# Feature: Authentication and Authorization

## Feature ID: FEAT-001
## Created: 2025-05-01
## Status: BLOCKED
## Target PI: TBD
## Platforms: Mobile, Web, Desktop

## Description
Implementation of federated authentication and claims-based authorization system for client applications. Users will authenticate through federated identity providers (Google, Facebook) and receive JWT tokens for API access.

## Business Value
- Secure access to platform features
- Seamless user experience with social login
- Consistent authorization across all platforms
- Foundation for personalized features

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to log in with my Google account so that I don't need to remember another password
- As a user, I want to log in with my Facebook account so that I can quickly access the app
- As a user, I want my session to stay active while I'm using the app so that I don't get logged out unexpectedly
- As a user, I want to securely log out when I'm done so that others can't access my account

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can authenticate via Google
- [ ] Users can authenticate via Facebook
- [ ] JWT tokens are securely stored
- [ ] Tokens are included in all API requests
- [ ] Sliding expiration is handled correctly
- [ ] Logout clears all session data
- [ ] Works offline with cached credentials

## Platform-Specific Requirements
### Mobile
- Native OAuth flow integration
- Secure token storage (Keychain/Keystore)
- Biometric authentication option

### Web
- OAuth redirect flow
- Secure session storage
- Remember me functionality

### Desktop
- Native OS credential storage
- Single sign-on support
- Auto-login option

## Technical Specifications
- OAuth 2.0 integration
- JWT token management
- API endpoint: `POST /api/auth/login`
- Token refresh via `X-Refreshed-Token` header
- 1-hour sliding expiration

## Dependencies
- Admin/API authentication implementation (BLOCKING)
- Federated identity provider setup
- Platform-specific OAuth libraries

## Notes
- Currently blocked waiting for Admin/API integration to be completed and stable
- Further refinement needed for native platform implementations
