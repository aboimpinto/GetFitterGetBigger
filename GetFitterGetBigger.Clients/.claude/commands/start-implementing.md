Start implementing a new feature from the READY_TO_DEVELOP folder for the Clients project.

Instructions:
1. Check /memory-bank/features/1-READY_TO_DEVELOP/ for available features
2. Select the highest priority feature or ask user which to implement
3. Move the feature to 2-IN_PROGRESS folder
4. Create implementation plan for multi-platform development
5. Identify shared vs platform-specific components
6. Start with shared ViewModels and services

Implementation approach:
- Begin with shared business logic (ViewModels, Services)
- Design responsive UI that works across platforms
- Identify platform-specific features early
- Plan offline support if applicable
- Consider platform-specific UI optimizations

Focus areas:
- MVVM architecture with testable ViewModels
- Cross-platform UI with platform refinements
- Service abstraction for platform features
- Navigation implementation
- State management approach
- Testing strategy (unit + UI tests)

Platform considerations:
- Which platforms need this feature?
- Any platform-specific requirements?
- UI/UX differences between platforms?
- Platform-specific APIs needed?
