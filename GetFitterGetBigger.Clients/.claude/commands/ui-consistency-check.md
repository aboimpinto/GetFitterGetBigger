Perform a UI/UX consistency check across all platforms for a specific feature or screen.

Instructions:
1. Identify the feature/screen to review across platforms
2. Check each platform's implementation (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
3. Verify consistent functionality while respecting platform conventions
4. Review responsive design and adaptability
5. Check accessibility across platforms
6. Ensure resource usage (strings, images, colors) is consistent

Review areas:
- **Visual Consistency**: Brand colors, fonts, spacing
- **Functional Consistency**: Same features available on all platforms
- **Navigation Patterns**: Platform-appropriate but functionally equivalent
- **Icon Usage**: Platform-specific icons that convey same meaning
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers, keyboard navigation
- **Localization**: All strings externalized and translated
- **Error Messages**: Consistent messaging across platforms
- **Loading States**: Similar feedback patterns
- **Offline Behavior**: Consistent offline experience

Platform-specific allowances:
- Navigation: Tabs (iOS) vs Navigation Drawer (Android)
- Back button: System back (Android) vs Navigation back (iOS)
- Styling: iOS flat design vs Material Design elevation
- Gestures: Platform-specific gesture recognition

Output format:
1. Feature Overview across platforms
2. Consistency Matrix (what's same/different)
3. Platform Guideline Compliance
4. Accessibility Report
5. Issues Found (with platform impact)
6. Screenshots/Mockups comparison (if available)
7. Recommendations for improvement
8. Overall Consistency Score

Goal: Achieve brand consistency while respecting platform user expectations.
