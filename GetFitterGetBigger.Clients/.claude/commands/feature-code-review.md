Perform a comprehensive final code review for the current feature following the code review process for multi-platform applications.

Instructions:
1. Identify the current feature being worked on from the git branch or active context
2. Review ALL changes against CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md and CLIENTS-CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md
3. Check platform-specific implementations (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
4. Verify cross-platform code sharing and platform abstractions
5. Assess MVVM implementation, navigation patterns, and state management
6. Create the review report with appropriate status (APPROVED/APPROVED_WITH_NOTES/REQUIRES_CHANGES)
7. Save the report as: `Final-Code-Review-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH-MM}-{STATUS}.md`
8. Place it in: `/memory-bank/features/2-IN_PROGRESS/FEAT-XXX/code-reviews/`

Focus areas:
- MVVM architecture compliance (ViewModels, data binding, commands)
- Cross-platform code reuse vs platform-specific implementations
- Platform abstraction layer correctness
- Navigation service implementation
- Offline support and data synchronization
- Performance across different platforms
- UI/UX consistency while respecting platform guidelines
- Accessibility on all platforms
- Resource management (images, strings, styles)
- Testing coverage (unit tests for ViewModels, UI tests)

Platform-specific checks:
- iOS: Human Interface Guidelines compliance, iOS-specific features
- Android: Material Design compliance, Android-specific features  
- Web: Progressive Web App capabilities, browser compatibility
- Desktop: Native desktop experience, keyboard/mouse support

The review should ensure the feature works correctly across all target platforms.
