Read the @memory-bank/ directory and catch up on the Clients project context, waiting for further instructions.

Focus on:
1. Current feature development status
2. Multi-platform architecture (shared vs platform-specific)
3. MVVM implementation patterns
4. Platform abstraction layer
5. API integration and offline support
6. UI/UX patterns across platforms
7. Testing strategy for multi-platform
8. Recent changes or issues

Platform-specific awareness:
- iOS project structure and patterns
- Android project structure and patterns  
- Web (if applicable) project structure
- Desktop (if applicable) project structure

After catching up, wait for the user to provide specific instructions.
